Some break up because they found another person who matches their desired qualities, and some for other reasons. The problem comes when you want to move from your current relationship to another. How do you do it?</p><p class=align-left>When a relationship ends, everyone gets hurt, especially the one who has been dumped. They may feel sad and disappointed because of the sudden shock of ending the relationship. Obviously, the one ending the relationship is usually not subjected to much pain and stress.</p><h3>How to break up with someone when you like someone else</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e7166403fae1e239.jpeg><p class=align-left>I'm in a relationship, but I love someone else. What will I do? If you genuinely find your feelings for your crush are beyond, and you can’t stay in your current relationship anymore, you can end the relationship in a kind, honest, and respectful way. So, how will you handle the break-up without affecting your partner adversely?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4639a4df265eeac5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to figure out fake friends and deal with them</span></p></a><h4>Think over what you want and why you want it</h4><ul><li><strong>Make sure the break-up is what you want:</strong> Falling for another person does not clearly indicate that you should end your relationship with your partner. You will only end things when you realize your partner’s interests, ideas, values, and feelings do not match what you wanted. If they don't fit, find ways of letting go the break-up thoughts.</li><li><strong>Write down the reasons why you want to break up:</strong> Take time to consider your feelings and the reasons for your decision. Then, ask yourself <a href=#>several questions</a> like will I give it another chance? Will things get better? Is the other person worth leaving my current relationship? Will I regret this decision?</li><li><strong>Reflect before taking action: </strong>Don't rush to break the news to your partner. Have your own time, and be clear and confident about your reasons for breaking up.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5d4ea8a548d380ba.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get out of the friend zone in 8 easy steps</span></p></a><h4>Think about what you'll say and how the other person might react</h4><p class=align-left>If ending the relationship is the best choice for you, then tell your current partner why the relationship is not working for you.</p><p class=align-left>Before breaking the sudden news, try to think about how your partner will receive or react to it. Will your partner get disappointed, hurt, mad, or cry? And if you get answers to your questions, you will be able to handle that kind of reaction.</p><h4>Have good intentions</h4><p class=align-left>Leaving a long-term relationship for another person can make you feel like you’re also letting go of everything it once was. But try to take the opportunity to appreciate the good things about the relationship, including anything you might have learned from it. Validate those feelings.</p><p class=align-left>Also, keep in mind that you should not attempt to give the details about your crush because that can be awfully hurtful to your partner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a5e08599a25d4ba3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I don't know what I want to do with my life - 10 tips to help you through this</span></p></a><h4>Be honest about your feelings</h4><p class=align-left>When breaking up with your partner, have an <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1216513-how-a-fun-conversation-girlfriend-25-talk-about.html href=#>honest conversation</a> and show some empathy, as it is really tough and hurting for the other person. It is also advisable to acknowledge the real issues that led to the break-up.</p><h4>Break up in person</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/d4169d8f242a16ce.jpeg><p class=align-left>If you have been dating for a long time, don’t break up with your partner by text, phone call or email. Instead, meet your partner in person and explain what led to the break-up, avoid text messages because this may sound disrespectful to your partner and maybe more hurtful.</p><h4>Take responsibility for your decision</h4><p class=align-left>Accept that breaking up is want you really wanted instead of taking the blame on your partner.</p><h4>Listen to your partner without defending yourself</h4><p class=align-left>Do not blame only the other person for the break-up. Give your partner enough time to <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1204873-questions-a-friend-better-2021.html href=#>ask questions </a>and answer them as you can.

It may be too difficult for him or her to accept the situation without a genuine explanation. Don’t mind if your partner gets mad and upset with what you have to say; instead, try to be calm and sympathetic.</p><h4>Don't disrespect your partner</h4><p class=align-left>Note that the person has been your significant partner, and you have been there for one another. Instead, try to show some appreciation for their good qualities.</p><h4>Don’t offer them false hope</h4><p class=align-left>Don’t try to make your partner feel better or give false hopes even as you are ending the relationship. Don’t let your partner think you could possibly get back together.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Is it normal to have feelings for someone else while in a relationship?</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes it is expected to have a crush on someone when you are in a long-term relationship.
