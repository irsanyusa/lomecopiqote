Media and Areas Studies (MARS) program is a 2-year Master’s degree program taught in English. It provides in-depth and critical knowledge about processes of mediation and signification, and how space and geography – the political and social specificities of an area – intersect with them. MARS is a collaboration between the Institute of Communication Studies and Journalism and the Institute of International Studies at Charles University.</p><p>Media and communication studies have a long tradition of emphasizing the importance of context, in dealing, for instance, with media production, content and interpretation/reception. And, of course, contexts are also spatial. Regions and countries, with their imagined communities, their politics, their institutional structures, their insides and outsides, impact in particular ways the media (infra)structures, media content and audience practices.</p><p>The backbone of MARS lies in the location of <a href=#>Prague</a>, the Czech Republic, Central and Eastern Europe and the European Union. This enables for two particular spatial focal points, which provide the backbone of the MARS programme, namely Central and Eastern Europe and the European Union. At the same time, MARS avoids an exclusive focus on Central and Eastern Europe, and offers knowledge about other European regions, or about Europe as a whole.</p><p>A second extension relates to more transnational and transcultural approaches, moving away from the logics of nation-state homogeneity, with emphasis on internal conflict and exclusion. This MARS backbone is combined with and strengthened by two main components: A theoretical component, which consists out of a combination of post-colonial theory, media sociology, memory studies and political geography. Moreover, also a methodological component provides the required support. These two focal points and the theoretical and methodological components structure the MARS programme.</p><p>Classes, which are taught in <a href=#>English</a>, consists of courses such as “Czech Media System in European Comparison,” “Conflict and Media in Southern Europe,” “Political Geography” and “Theorizing Memory” that all look at this intersection of media, politics and space. Research and vocational internships are also part of the program.</p><p>Graduates in Master’s programme of MARS will have acquired factual knowledge of the cultural and historical position of media and media communication within the geographic area of Central Eastern Europe. They will understand the social and political contexts of Central Eastern Europe, and the wider context of the European Union and the neighboring European regions. Their in-depth knowledge of the media and political ecology in Central Eastern Europe and the European Union will support their future employment in more senior/advisory positions in a variety of social fields and organizations, including state administrations, private sector (including media), public service institutions, and non-profit organizations.</p><p>Admissions to MARS are now open for Autumn 2020.</p><p>Applicants for MARS programme will need to have obtained their BA certificates by the time of the start of the first semester of their studies. Although a background in media and communication studies, international relations, political studies/sciences, or other related disciplines will prove advantageous for the students during the programme, highly motivated applicants with backgrounds in other fields are also welcomed to apply.</p><h3>The following documents must be provided in addition to the application form:</h3><ul><li>Copy of a diploma to show completed bachelor studies, or confirmation of ongoing bachelor studies in the academic year that those studies will be completed</li><li>Transcript of marks and academic results from previous bachelor studies</li><li>CV</li><li>Motivation letter</li><li>Document showing level achieved in the English language (if applicable)</li><li>Applications may also include:</li><li>References or letters of recommendation</li><li>Writing sample – the best relevant academic text written by the student (essay, thesis, analysis, case study etc.)</li></ul><p>For more information about the programme, visit https://marsmaster.fsv.cuni.cz/.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Crq6KbnJp8pLTAq6Oeq12qu6rCxKuqoqypYravwsitnKxlo6nCpbHNrapmrJ9iwLXBw7JkraCVYravwMSrqp6bpJ68r3nOn2SmnZSerm6tzZ1kqaecnsGqr9I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
