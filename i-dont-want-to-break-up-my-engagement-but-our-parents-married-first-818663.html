They also left&nbsp;us alone, but that all stopped after their wedding.</p><p>It&nbsp;started with weird comments from them, here and there, and my&nbsp;mother all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden started talking to&nbsp;me&nbsp;about this pretty girl she works with or&nbsp;the new girl at&nbsp;the grocery store wanting to&nbsp;introduce&nbsp;me. Her father basically did the same but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;more subtle way, talking about not getting married young, traveling enjoying life.

They got visibly angry, yelling at&nbsp;us and asking what people think, are we&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;make them look bad, we&nbsp;are siblings. The joke of&nbsp;us dating has gone on&nbsp;long enough, and it’s time we&nbsp;break up&nbsp;because we&nbsp;are no&nbsp;longer allowed to&nbsp;date each other because we&nbsp;became a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> after they married.</p><p>They actually demanded that we&nbsp;call off the engagement and break up&nbsp;because they were tired of&nbsp;how awkward we&nbsp;made them feel and having to&nbsp;hear people talking behind their backs.

I&nbsp;have an&nbsp;aunt and uncle who got married, her mother died a&nbsp;year prior, his dad had died a&nbsp;few years prior, low and behold the single parents married not long after my&nbsp;aunt and uncle did. Aside from a&nbsp;few jokes within the family, it&nbsp;was never even remotely a&nbsp;thing.<br>It’s not as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they or&nbsp;you and your fiancé for that matter, were raised in&nbsp;the same home since childhood and raised as&nbsp;siblings, that would be&nbsp;weird. Your parents are just kind of&nbsp;shallow and thought they could browbeat you into submission. Ignore them, marry that girl, and wait for the apology.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>PrideFit2236&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Your parents can kick rocks. If&nbsp;they are embarrassed, they can move towns and change their names. Who knows if&nbsp;their relationship will even survive? If&nbsp;they ever get divorced, you’ll be&nbsp;happy you stayed together.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>jr_hosep&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“An&nbsp;8-year relationship surpasses a&nbsp;3-year-old one, so&nbsp;they should be&nbsp;divorcing so&nbsp;you can get married. Clearly, they wouldn’t even be&nbsp;together if&nbsp;not for you and your ‘step-sis’.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sososoftmeows&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“If&nbsp;you have not already announced your engagement on&nbsp;SM then do&nbsp;so&nbsp;very soon. Make sure you include something like ‘After blank years of&nbsp;dating she said yes to&nbsp;forever with&nbsp;me’ or&nbsp;‘After blank years of&nbsp;dating he&nbsp;asked, and&nbsp;I said yes.’ Then make sure you note the same information on&nbsp;a&nbsp;large sign at&nbsp;the wedding venue. Something like ‘After blank years of&nbsp;dating &&nbsp;blank months being engaged, we&nbsp;are happy to&nbsp;begin our forever together.’<br>If&nbsp;they continue to&nbsp;disapprove of&nbsp;your relationship, then you may find it&nbsp;is&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;not invite the parents to&nbsp;the wedding and just remove them from your life, but if&nbsp;it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;that extreme action then make sure all family and friends know exactly why they are not a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your life. If&nbsp;you do&nbsp;not invite them to&nbsp;the wedding, then, I&nbsp;would make a&nbsp;little speech about why they are not there.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>countryboy1101&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e1/56e/eaaaaa59988f65f4946f40e021.jpg><ul><li>“Tell your parents they need to&nbsp;divorce, since they are the ones who decided to&nbsp;make themselves look weird.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>RaymondBeaumont&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It’s clear that their child’s happiness is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;priority for either of&nbsp;them.

It&nbsp;sounds incestuous, but it’s not. And it’s an&nbsp;easily explained description: both sets of&nbsp;grandparents have been friends since my&nbsp;parents were children. A&nbsp;brother and sister from one side paired up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;brother and sister from the other side. But more importantly, the people involved in&nbsp;my&nbsp;family know it’s not at&nbsp;all wrong.
