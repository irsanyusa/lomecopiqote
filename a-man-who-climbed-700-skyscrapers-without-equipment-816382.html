Harry Gardiner tried and nailed it many times in the early 1900s. For instance, in 1916, he climbed up the Omaha World-Herald building while more than 30,000 people were his audience."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For instance, in&nbsp;1916, he&nbsp;climbed up&nbsp;the Omaha World-Herald building while more than 30,000 people were his audience. Now, let’s time-travel to&nbsp;that period. Charlie Chaplin was making movies. Skyscrapers started to&nbsp;rise one by&nbsp;one, and clothing trends were changing. Men’s outfits got a&nbsp;more casual look. Suits became more common.</p><p>The styles went beyond the silk top hat. Felt derby and bowler hats became the “go-to” accessories for males of&nbsp;the 1910s. Take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;Harry Gardiner in&nbsp;this picture. It&nbsp;looks like he&nbsp;is&nbsp;photoshopped to&nbsp;that building. Most of&nbsp;the time, he&nbsp;wore just his ordinary street clothes when he&nbsp;climbed skyscrapers.</p><p>You want to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know this world-famous gentleman climber? He&nbsp;is&nbsp;also known as&nbsp;“the Human Fly.” The nickname is&nbsp;super reasonable, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;climbed over 700 buildings in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Europe data-link=tag>Europe</a> and North America. His performance on&nbsp;the 150-foot-high Grant’s Tomb in&nbsp;New York was the climb that got the spotlights on&nbsp;him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f4b/c00/d6a1ae55feac383ff43c901128.png><p>All is&nbsp;very well, but how did he&nbsp;do&nbsp;it? He&nbsp;had exceptionally strong hands. He&nbsp;sometimes used a&nbsp;short length of&nbsp;rope too. It&nbsp;wasn’t just this that brought him success. He&nbsp;was quite a&nbsp;performer. His wide smile and round glasses were a&nbsp;perfect fit for the camera, papers, and of&nbsp;course, spectators. He&nbsp;didn’t merely climb buildings for fun. He&nbsp;turned his gift and fame into money. While he&nbsp;scaled different constructions with his bare hands, he&nbsp;seized the opportunity to&nbsp;promote businesses.</p><p>Companies were willing to&nbsp;pay him to&nbsp;see their goods advertised to&nbsp;a&nbsp;large audience below. He&nbsp;advertised banks, movies, and, ironically enough, life insurance companies&nbsp;— none of&nbsp;which of&nbsp;course would offer him coverage. The top point of&nbsp;his career was in&nbsp;Detroit in&nbsp;1916. Gardiner gathered 150,000 people to&nbsp;watch his performance at&nbsp;the 14-story Majestic Building! He&nbsp;was like an&nbsp;old-day human&nbsp;TV for companies. They could reach hundreds of&nbsp;people at&nbsp;once.</p><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t all sunshine and butterflies, though. Multiple times he&nbsp;faced the worst outcome he&nbsp;could get while climbing. In&nbsp;1915, he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;climb the state capitol in&nbsp;Columbia, South Carolina. He&nbsp;fell 50&nbsp;feet. He&nbsp;broke his ribs and damaged the building with his fall. Did it&nbsp;stop him? Nope. Climbing urban structures became a&nbsp;strange phenomenon in&nbsp;the 20th century. Gardiner inspired many people.</p><p>Unfortunately, not everyone was as&nbsp;talented as&nbsp;him. Copycats did not, shall we&nbsp;say, “succeed” in&nbsp;their climbs. They didn’t have 9&nbsp;lives. That’s why states and cities put official restrictions on&nbsp;urban climbing. As&nbsp;for Gardiner, he&nbsp;disappeared into thin air. It’s speculated that he&nbsp;left for <a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a>. A&nbsp;man was once found at&nbsp;the base of&nbsp;the <a href=# title="Eiffel Tower" data-link=tag>Eiffel Tower</a>. People claimed that he&nbsp;fit Gardiner’s description. Still, how his story ended is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mystery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ab8/cc4/d109dc51498f26f88aa076cf72.png><p>Needless to&nbsp;say, but&nbsp;I will anyway, climbing buildings is&nbsp;extremely dangerous. Yet, it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;new phenomenon over time. Climbing urban structures, as&nbsp;Gardiner did, is&nbsp;called “buildering.” Uh, is&nbsp;“buildering” a&nbsp;word? Yeah, it’s a&nbsp;combo of&nbsp;2&nbsp;words: bouldering and building.</p><p>People who do&nbsp;it&nbsp;are referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;“builderers.” So&nbsp;that’s what I’m going to&nbsp;call them too. Most builderers are free and solo climbers. This means that they climb without a&nbsp;rope or&nbsp;other types of&nbsp;protection. If&nbsp;they fall, they can get severe injuries&nbsp;or, you know, worse. Because of&nbsp;that, most of&nbsp;the time, it’s illegal to&nbsp;builder high buildings.</p><p>Now, you might ask, “Isn’t buildering just a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;parkour?” Nope. It&nbsp;does have something in&nbsp;common with parkour and free running. Yet, buildering has a&nbsp;different history and style. Parkour is&nbsp;an&nbsp;athletic training discipline or&nbsp;sport in&nbsp;which people try to&nbsp;pass obstacles by&nbsp;running, vaulting, jumping, climbing, and so&nbsp;on&nbsp;to&nbsp;get from point&nbsp;A to&nbsp;point&nbsp;B in&nbsp;the fastest and most efficient way.</p><p>Parkour practitioners also don’t wear or&nbsp;have any assisting equipment. Buildering occurs in&nbsp;urban areas, but parkour can take place anywhere. Parkour was popularized in&nbsp;<a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a> in&nbsp;the late 1980s. Then it&nbsp;got even more popular with the help of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Internet data-link=tag>Internet</a>. It&nbsp;has acrobatic movements. These movements have existed before in&nbsp;various communities around the world for centuries, in&nbsp;Africa and China, for instance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ce5/8c6/f485c25e5cbf8d660ef4101858.png><p>Back to&nbsp;buildering itself. It&nbsp;has grown in&nbsp;popularity since the early 1900s. For instance, in&nbsp;the 70s and 80s, builderers climbed the world’s tallest buildings to&nbsp;set new records. Here we&nbsp;can mention George Willig. He&nbsp;climbed one of&nbsp;two 110-story towers in&nbsp;New York in&nbsp;1977, but he&nbsp;was fined $250,000. Luckily, the mayor eventually only fined him around 1&nbsp;cent per floor.</p><p>Geoffrey Winthrop Young was another builderer. In&nbsp;1895, he&nbsp;climbed the roofs of&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Cambridge. Imagine walking on&nbsp;the campus and seeing your mate Geoffrey on&nbsp;the roof of&nbsp;the library building.</p><p>The next builderer we&nbsp;should mention is&nbsp;Dan Goodwin. In&nbsp;1981, he&nbsp;climbed a&nbsp;skyscraper that had 110 floors wearing suction cups. And he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;Spider-Man suit&nbsp;on. He&nbsp;called himself “Spider-Dan.” He&nbsp;had another wild accomplishment.</p><p>He&nbsp;climbed the CN&nbsp;Tower in&nbsp;Toronto in&nbsp;1986 without suction cups. Using only his hands and feet! It&nbsp;was the tallest structure in&nbsp;the world from 1975 to&nbsp;2007&nbsp;— an&nbsp;equivalent of&nbsp;a&nbsp;146-floor building. You might know that now, Burj Khalifa is&nbsp;the tallest building in&nbsp;the world. Do&nbsp;you think someone has dared to&nbsp;climb&nbsp;it, too?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/671/2dd/4a66665d99883d7673f210136a.png><p>The answer is&nbsp;yes. Alain Robert is&nbsp;known for climbing tall buildings using the free solo technique. In&nbsp;2011, Robert climbed the 2,717 feet tall Burj Khalifa tower in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Dubai data-link=tag>Dubai</a>. It&nbsp;took him 6&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;climb&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;used a&nbsp;harness as&nbsp;a&nbsp;safety procedure. He&nbsp;got arrested many times for illegally climbing buildings in&nbsp;various countries. Yet, he&nbsp;also succeeded in&nbsp;legal climbs and even got some sponsorship, too.</p><p>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock climber, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;has physical training and knows the climbing technique. This allows him to&nbsp;make his way up&nbsp;using window ledges and frames of&nbsp;windows instead of&nbsp;the edges of&nbsp;rocks. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;very fast and athletic, but even he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;stop in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;his attempts. For instance, in&nbsp;2002, he&nbsp;was scaling an&nbsp;800-ft-tall skyscraper in&nbsp;London, but he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;halfway through because of&nbsp;rain.</p><p>Another notable name is&nbsp;a&nbsp;present-day builderer and photographer, Lucinda Grange. She is&nbsp;known for scaling iconic buildings. She adds another level to&nbsp;this thrill. She carries her camera with her and takes awesome pictures from the tops of&nbsp;buildings. She’s scaled the Newport Transporter Bridge, the Great Pyramids of&nbsp;Giza, the Chrysler Building in&nbsp;Manhattan, and many more.</p><p>She is&nbsp;known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“daredevil photographer.” She takes the risk of&nbsp;injury and legal consequences while trying to&nbsp;escape security guards. She wears cool dresses in&nbsp;those pictures, which is&nbsp;also challenging. Besides that, she takes underground pictures, like snaps of&nbsp;London Tube tunnels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/462/100/e9702f595ba7064f09dec56a17.png><p>Angela Nikolau is&nbsp;the next name. She captures urban areas and streets and takes underground photos too. But she is&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;list because of&nbsp;her buildering snaps.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re afraid of&nbsp;the height, you might not want to&nbsp;follow her on&nbsp;Insta. Her pictures can give you a&nbsp;vertigo effect. You can see her on&nbsp;the roof of&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-rise building or&nbsp;on&nbsp;its edge, lying in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bodysuit or&nbsp;high heels or&nbsp;doing some gymnastic tricks. She has started creating NFT works, too.</p><p>It’s a&nbsp;super dangerous thing to&nbsp;do, and no&nbsp;one should try it&nbsp;if&nbsp;they don’t trust their physical abilities and mental limits. Congrats to&nbsp;the people who are willing and able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. Would you try to&nbsp;climb a&nbsp;skyscraper?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uucCnZLCgn2KwrbXMm5ydZWdlfW6%2FyrKqnKqRpbKzv4ywoK2gn6rBbrHQrqCppZWjwW6EkG9qcWpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
