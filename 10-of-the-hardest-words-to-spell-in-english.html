If you’re not a natural-born speller, English pronunciation and spelling rules can be a real challenge and grounds for a massive headache.
Just when you think you’ve gotten the hang of how one sound is spelled, a rhyming word pops up with an entirely different spelling—take “meat” and “greet” for example—and your world comes crumbling down."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Nauseous</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> Having the feeling that you’re going to vomit</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>Starting off our list of most difficult words to spell is “nauseous.” Despite looking like it might be pronounced “NAW-see-us,” this word is actually pronounced “NAW-shus.”</p><p>Everyday words that contain a “sh” sound in the middle more commonly use a “ti” as in “cautious” (“CAW-shus”—which rhymes with “nauseous”) or “nation” (“NAY-shun”), so this “eous” business might trip you up. Why can’t it be “nautious”?<strong>How to use it: </strong>“I can’t go on sailboats. The swaying up and down always makes me feel nauseous.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Dilate>2. Dilate</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>To become or make something wider or larger</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>For some reason, many English speakers pronounce this as a three-syllable word, “DI-a-late”—but that’s not it. Don’t be tempted to add that extra “a” in there! The correct pronunciation of this word is “dai-layt.”</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“Your pupils dilate to let in more light so you can see when it’s dark.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Fuchsia>3. Fuchsia</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>A vibrant red-purple color</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>The spelling of this word, which is pronounced “FEW-sha,” makes no sense—it looks like it says “FEWCH-sia” or “FUCH-see-uh.” Why isn’t it just “fucia”?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“You’ll see me. I’ll be standing outside the coffee shop wearing a bright fuchsia dress.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Minuscule>4. Minuscule</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>Very small</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>What makes this word tricky is that you might associate it with “mini,” derived from “miniature,” a Latin word that refers to something tiny. So it would be understandable if you wanted to spell this one “miniscule.” But that’s not the case! Make sure you spell this one with a “u.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“Even if you can only save a minuscule amount of money every day, it can add up in the long run.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Ingenious>5. Ingenious</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>Extremely clever; a very smart idea</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>Why does “ingenious” contain an “o” when “genius” doesn’t? This may surprise you, but the two words don’t share the same <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">roots</a>!</p><p>Their meanings may seem similar, but “ingenious” doesn’t actually describe a genius-level idea. Once you can get your head around that, you’ll have an easier time remembering the spelling of this word.</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“Using two pancakes in place of sandwich bread? Ingenious!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Sacrilegious->6. Sacrilegious&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>Disrespectful toward something holy or sacred—this word is sometimes used humorously</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>Because it’s connected to the idea of anti-holiness, many people hear the word “religious” in this one; therefore, they want to spell it “sacreligious.” However, this word actually comes from the noun “sacrilege,” and has no “religious” roots.</p><p><strong>How to use it:</strong> “You’re Canadian and you don’t like maple syrup? That’s sacrilegious!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Orangutan>7. Orangutan</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>A large ape with brownish-red hair</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>Is this a typo? Why wouldn’t there be a “g” at the end of this word? Well, contrary to popular belief, this animal is not called an “orangutang.” We’re not sure exactly where that pronunciation came from, but it’s quite widespread—and so is the misspelling of the word.</p><p><strong>How to use it: “</strong>Did you know that orangutans spend almost their whole lives in trees?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Paraphernalia>8. Paraphernalia</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>Particular objects needed for a certain activity</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>If you don’t think this one belongs on our list of the hardest words to spell in the English language, maybe you’re spelling it wrong!</p><p>Many people <a href=#>mistakenly pronounce</a> this word “para-fa-NEEL-ia” leaving the second “r” silent and changing the second-last “a” (a long “a” sound) to a long “e” instead. As a result, you might be tempted to write “paraphenelia.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“The trunk of my car is such a mess—all of my workout paraphernalia is in there.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Epitome>9. Epitome</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> The best example of something; a perfect representation</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>If you’ve only ever heard this word before and have never seen it written, you may have thought it was spelled “epitomy”—after all, it ends with a long “e” sound, so using a “y” seems like the logical choice. But, just like the word <a href=#>anemone</a>, that final sound is represented by the letter “e.” This is far less common than using a “y,” and is, therefore, a little confusing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: “</strong>My ex-boyfriend is the epitome of selfishness.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10.-Slough>10. Slough</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>1. To shed something (e.g., skin) 2. A wet, swampy area</p><p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>We chose this word to end our list because, no matter what the definition, the spelling could be so much more straightforward than it is. If you’re referring to the first definition, the act of shedding, “slough” is pronounced “sluff.”</p><p>The swampy definition, however, is commonly pronounced “slew” in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American English</a>, but also sometimes rhymes with “wow.” Who decided that two words that are pronounced completely differently should share this unintuitive spelling?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>English spelling: The epitome of confusion</h2><p>If this list of the hardest English words to spell has your head spinning, you’re not alone; lots of others feel the same way.</p><p>If you are feeling even more ambitious, we have a few extra words that often present a challenge to spell correctly.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mischievous</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>What it means:</strong> showing a fondness for causing trouble in a playful way</li><li><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> Despite what you might hear all the time – mis-CHEE-vee-us, according to dictionaries, it’s pronounced MIS-cha (with a schwa sound) -vus.</li><li><strong>How to use it:</strong> “That mischievous grin on his face told me he was up to no good.”</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Charcuterie</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>What it means:</strong> A selection of cold-cooked meats.</li><li><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> The French origins of this word make it hard to spell accurately. The French have a very different system of spelling, which can make it confusing when we adopt their words into English.<br>In French, the letters “char” are pronounced “shahr”. That’s why this fancy word is spelled with a ch instead of the sh you might expect.</li><li><strong>How to use it:</strong> “We’re having a charcuterie board for dinner tonight, with a variety of meats, cheeses, and pickles.”</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Worcestershire</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>What it means:</strong> A county in the West Midlands of England, or a type of sauce made from vinegar, sugar, and spices</li><li><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> This word is pronounced like wu-stur-shr, and the spelling of the word looks like there’s at least one syllable too many.</li><li><strong>How to use it:</strong> “Would you like some Worcestershire sauce on your steak?”</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Interesting Fact: The spelling bee contest</strong></h2><p>Originating in the United States, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>spelling bees</strong></a> have gained popularity as a means to motivate students to learn standardized correct spelling.</p><p>Dating back to the 19th century, these spelling bee competitions were initially inspired by Noah Webster’s spelling books, such as “The Blue-backed Speller.”</p><p>The term “spelling bee” itself has been in use since 1850. Spelling bees are now held in various countries worldwide, with Webster’s Third New International Dictionary serving as a key reference for participants.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><p>Here are also some of the questions people ask about spelling words in English</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How can you guess the correct spelling of English words?</strong></h3><p>When spelling words, breaking down the word into smaller chunks to learn the right spellings might make it easier to spell a word correctly.
