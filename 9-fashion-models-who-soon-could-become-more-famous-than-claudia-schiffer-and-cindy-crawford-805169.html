The theme of&nbsp;the event was American fashion, and the girl represented the culture of&nbsp;the Navajo Nation. Her look immediately went <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>viral</a>. Quanna is&nbsp;the only Native American model. She has been interested in&nbsp;fashion since childhood, and in&nbsp;2020 she signed a&nbsp;contract with Calvin Klein. Since then, her career has taken off.</p><p>The most recognizable detail of&nbsp;Quanna’s appearance is&nbsp;the tattoo on&nbsp;her face. She got it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>14</a>&nbsp;and reclaimed the ancient tradition of&nbsp;her people. Previously, such a&nbsp;tattoo would be&nbsp;given to&nbsp;girls between the ages of&nbsp;12&nbsp;and 14&nbsp;to&nbsp;mark her passage into womanhood, and Quanna became the first of&nbsp;the modern girls of&nbsp;the tribe to&nbsp;have it&nbsp;at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;young age. By&nbsp;the way, Quanna was tattooed by&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mother</a>, a&nbsp;tradition that was customary in&nbsp;the past.</p><p>The model lives in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alaska</a> and protects the nature of&nbsp;the Arctic.
