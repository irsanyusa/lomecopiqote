She films her face from different angles, showcasing her natural beauty without makeup. However, her focus is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the area under her eye, which is&nbsp;inflamed and causing her discomfort.</p><p>Bella shares that she has been suffering from an&nbsp;infection that has been spreading underneath one of&nbsp;her teeth. She had initially thought it&nbsp;was the same tooth she had gotten a&nbsp;root canal on&nbsp;a&nbsp;year ago, but a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;the dentist revealed that the infection was underneath an&nbsp;adjacent tooth.</p><p><h2>She and some family members have another disease.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d11/20b/4a5b2058ac9b18445e69d1b449.jpg><p>Bella explained that the infection was spreading and causing a&nbsp;low-grade infection in&nbsp;her jaw. In&nbsp;her own words, “If&nbsp;not, it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;take me&nbsp;out!” This infection has been particularly challenging for her, given her ongoing battle with Lyme disease.</p><p>Bella was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed</a> with Lyme disease in&nbsp;2012, along with her mother and brother, and the infection has caused her Lyme to&nbsp;flare&nbsp;up, attacking various parts of&nbsp;her body, including her jaw, spine, and nervous system.</p><p><h2>Bella advised fans to&nbsp;prioritize self-care.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ead/108/4878fc5b24921265ea27ac41a5.jpg><p>That’s Bella and her mother in&nbsp;the photo above. Bella urged her fans to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;their bodies and take care of&nbsp;themselves, as&nbsp;any physical or&nbsp;mental change can trigger a&nbsp;relapse. The inflammation in&nbsp;her jaw has been particularly difficult, and it&nbsp;has become increasingly aggressive, causing her to&nbsp;seek medical attention.</p><p>Despite the challenges she is&nbsp;facing, Bella Hadid is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;stay positive and finding ways to&nbsp;cope. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent update, she shared that she has good and bad days but feels better when riding horses. She also revealed that she started 2&nbsp;rounds of&nbsp;antibiotics and is&nbsp;getting the problematic tooth extracted to&nbsp;heal the infection.</p><p><h2>Her disease caused anxiety and changed her appearance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/746/3a1/989f8f501b927819505e75346a.jpg><p>Bella revealed that most of&nbsp;her pictures and selfies look a&nbsp;certain way on&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal basis when she’s flaring up&nbsp;due to&nbsp;working a&nbsp;lot, experiencing stress, and dealing with Lyme disease. She explained that her skin changes color, she breaks out randomly, and she experiences lethargy, chronic anxiety, and a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;motivation or&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>Bella Hadid previously shared how her diagnosis impacted her <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a>, as&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2022 <i>Vogue</i> interview that she would wake up&nbsp;every morning feeling anxious and in&nbsp;tears. She would cry alone at&nbsp;work and in&nbsp;her hotel room, without showing anyone her struggles. Watch her TikTok video below.</p><p>Bella’s willingness to&nbsp;open up&nbsp;about these issues is&nbsp;inspiring and reminds&nbsp;us that celebrities are not immune to&nbsp;health struggles. It&nbsp;also raises awareness about Lyme disease and the importance of&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;one’s physical and mental health. We&nbsp;can only hope that Bella finds relief from her symptoms and continues to&nbsp;share her journey with her fans.</p><p>Take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;these articles too, believe&nbsp;us, they will make you see the <strong>Bright Side</strong> of&nbsp;the world:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZussSeo2arn2KvorCMn6arZZ2ueqO7w7Jkm52coa5utMCdoJ1ll57Dpr%2BMrqpmmV2nrrOxjKWmqKNdlsFuwMeeZJ2ho5qutLGMrZ%2BarF2YtaK6xp6bZqCVp3qnrcKeZHFpYmuDdXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
