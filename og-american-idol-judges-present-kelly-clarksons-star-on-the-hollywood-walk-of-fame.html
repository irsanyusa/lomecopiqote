Nonetheless, such was seemingly an act of fate, since she recently celebrated the <a href=#>20 year anniversary</a> of her American Idol win.</p><p>“This is where I won 20 years ago,” she stated during her acceptance speech. “I feel very lucky and fortunate because I know a lot of talented people that love singing and are amazing at it and writing songs, and even talk show hosts — a lot of people could do that, and I just feel very fortunate that I get the chance.”</p><p>Furthermore, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Clarkson said that it was “incredible” to be a part of the artists that she used to see in pictures as a kid.</p><p>“With all these major people that influenced you, artistically, in your life, and it’s cool to be a part of that,” she stressed.</p><p>Coincidentally, Clarkson’s star was placed between Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool). The singer joked that this placement is a perfect representation of both “magic and sarcasm.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Cowell Knew Kelly Clarkson Would be a Star</h2><p>Original <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> judges, Cowell, Jackson, and Abdul were also present to congratulate the singer. The four even posed for photos while Clarkson was holding her star. While at the event, Cowell reflected on how Clarkson became the game changer of the talent show.</p><p>“I actually thought I was being punked on the first day. Paula resigned. Every singer was out of tune and it got worse, progressively,” he said. “I remember the day we met you and I remember not just your voice, but your personality.”</p><p>Apparently, Cowell still remembers her audition like it was yesterday. From day one, he knew that her career was going to be unstoppable.</p><p>“I always say if someone knows their lane, you’re gonna be a star, if you got the talent. And Kelly has always known her lane,” he said.</p><p>Although Clarkson has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maintained friendships</a> with the original American Idol judges throughout the years, this moment was truly like none other. Their inclusion in the ceremony was loved by fans.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_DrakeMilligan_Casey-DurkinNBC.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Heartthrob Drake Milligan Tops the iTunes Charts with New Album" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zqBkmqWVp7akrc1moJ2nnGK3trDGnqpmqKKawKa602ainqScrnqkuMCroqynnqh6tMDAq2Sopl2ptaZ5x6ijpbGnpLyledaao6Rln5t6p63MnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
