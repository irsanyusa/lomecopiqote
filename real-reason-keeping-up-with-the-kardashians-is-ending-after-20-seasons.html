Are you crying yet? Keep reading to see the official announcement.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kim Kardashian Confirms ‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians’ Is Ending</h2><p>Kim Kardashian posted a statement on social media to commemorate the amazing empire that the show has documented for 14 years. The official statement says “It is with heavy hearts that we say goodbye to&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians. After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and several spin-off shows, we’ve decided as a family to end this very special journey.” It continues “We are beyond grateful to all of you who’ve watched us for all of these years—through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We’ll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we’ve met along the way.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YOU’LL NEVER GUESS WHICH BATHROOM PRODUCTS KIM KARDASHIAN WILL BE SELLING</a></strong></p><p>“Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience and most importantly, a very special thank you to&nbsp;Ryan Seacrest&nbsp;for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray who’ve spent countless hours filming our lives.&nbsp;Our last season will air early next year in 2021.&nbsp;We love you!” the statement finishes. Kim added her own little anecdotes to her own personal statement which you can see above.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why Is The Show Ending?</h3><p>The E! network also posted a statement that says the following: “E! has been the home and extended family to the Kardashian-Jenners for what will be 14 years, featuring the lives of this empowering family. Along with all of you, we have enjoyed following the intimate moments the family so bravely shared by letting us into their daily lives. While it has been an absolute privilege and we will miss them wholeheartedly, we respect the family’s decision to live their lives without our cameras. It is not our final goodbye yet, we are excited to have the new season of&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&nbsp;launching on September 17 with the final season airing in 2021. We thank the entire extended family and our production partners, Bunim Murray and Ryan Seacrest Productions for embarking on this global phenomenon together.”&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> KIM KARDASHIAN IS ALSO APPARENTLY A BILLIONAIRE NOW BUT HOPEFULLY THIS SISTER ISN’T LYING</a></strong></p><p>Of course, everyone has a ton of questions about why the show is ending. The show recently just aired a six-episode season that saw an immense drop in ratings. The show’s ratings actually dropped by about two million viewers. “In five weeks, they slipped from just over 1 million to 800,000 questionable fans”<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> according to Showbiz.</a> This lack of viewership could have been a driving force behind ending the show along with the fact that each of the girls has so many other business ventures to pursue. The return of their show in September will feature scenes from quarantine as the Kardashian’s will take us through exactly they have been surviving throughout the coronavirus pandemic.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Are Absolutely Freaking Out That ‘KUWTK’ Is Ending</h3><p>As you can imagine, so many fans have grown up watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians and are so sad to see it come to an end.
