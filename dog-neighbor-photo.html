It has been liked nearly 170,000 times since posting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of course this sensation of a dog collected plenty of praise and awe from the collective minds of the internet who shared their feelings about it. Some said they loved it. In a following tweet, the Twitter user appeared to clarify “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m not familiar with the folks</a>,” who trimmed the hedge.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s my friend’s neighborhood. I happened to see a giant hedge that was the same shape as my dog so I thought I would have her pose in front of it,” the owner, Matthew, told TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Evidently Luna loves to strike a pose and “this photo is no different,” the owner said. “In the moment I thought it was a great photo op so I couldn’t help but have my dog pose in front of it,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But as internet denizens were fully engrossed in the image, some wondered if the trill trimmer known as Edward Scissorhands was responsible for the canine-like landscaping.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The sensation of a dog is clearly loving being a muse. This moment is about the triumph of the animal spirit. And it is truly something to behold.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">owner’s Instagram post</a> only helped the photo along to viral status.
