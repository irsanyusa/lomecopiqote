The Peloton instructor will be hitting the dance floor with his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pro partner</a> during the Sept. 20 premiere. What you probably don’t know is that Rigsby is a pro dancer himself.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-dancing-with-the-stars-contestant-cody-rigsby>Who is ‘Dancing with the Stars’ Contestant Cody Rigsby?</h2><p>Before he became the Peloton master, Rigsby pursued a professional career as a dancer in New York City. The Greensboro, North Carolina native also took smaller gigs in the fashion industry. He did attend free ballet classes in college before landing an internship at Broadway Dance Center. Eventually, he got the opportunity to dance with some big-name acts.</p><p>“In my former life before fitness, I was a professional dancer,” he said on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Morning America</a>. “I danced for <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>, Nicki Minaj, so she’s used to busting a move.”</p><p>Eventually, a choreographer friend helped him secure an interview with Peloton. He became one of the first hires at the company, making $150&nbsp;per class when he first started out. Peloton sales soared during the pandemic, and Rigsby has since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>become a millionaire</a> due to all of his success. He just purchased a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.46 million Williamsburg penthouse</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CPUTeFXNxGu/?utm_medium=share_sheet</p></figure><p>Clips of Rigsby’s 30-minute Peloton rides have gone viral on TikTok. He has been working for the company for seven years now and has certainly helped take it to new heights. Rigsby has partnerships with Adidas and GM. His “Xoxo, Cody” rides are a favorite amongst fans who love hearing him talk about pop culture.</p><p>Rigsby has become one of the most popular Peloton instructors due to his outgoing personality. In February, he contracted COVID-19. He posted about how he was feeling, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Today Show</a> decided to dedicate an entire segment to him. He has since made a full recovery.</p><p>Rigsby has become one of the most famous voices in the #FreeBritney movement. His videos about the subject have gone viral on all social media platforms. We wouldn’t be surprised if he reaches 1 million Instagram followers by the end of the week. And oh yeah, he has rock-solid abs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rigsby-isn-t-the-only-professional-dancer-competing-this-season>Rigsby Isn’t the Only Professional Dancer Competing This Season</h2><p>Rigsby is hilarious and probably will not have a hard time getting Dancing with the Stars viewers to vote for him. He makes killer playlists and has awesome moves to match. The only problem is, being a professional dancer raises questions about what is fair and unfair. It will be easier for him to pick up the choreography. He already has great endurance and stamina, two things that are tested to the limits on Dancing with the Stars.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BkL4oZoHBWY/?utm_medium=share_sheet</p></figure><p>JoJo Siwa has already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">generated a ton of buzz</a> for being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a trained dancer</a> competing on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 30</a> of Dancing with the Stars. Siwa rose to fame on Dance Moms, learning routines from Abby Lee Miller. Rigsby, Siwa, and Amanda Kloots could have some major advantages in the competition due to their dance backgrounds.</p><p>“I think it’s going to be interesting to see because I am a trained dancer and that’s no secret, and I’ve been a dancer my whole life, but never in this land,”&nbsp;Siwa said on Good Morning America. “I’ve never done ballroom, I’ve never done anything Latin, so it’s going to be totally different.”</p><p>Kloots is a former Radio City Rockette. She professionally danced for 16 years in New York City before becoming a fitness trainer. Contests with prior dance experience usually do really well in the competition like Normani, Zendaya, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Scherzinger</a>. Rigsby, Siwa, and Kloots are all ones to watch during the season premiere. At least one of them is probably going to end up making it to the finale.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Masked-Singer-Baby-Fox.jpeg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Season 6 Baby Costume is Absolutely Terrifying" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYrCwsNhmqaKfo5fGbrzRqGSdmZ6YsrN5z56jqKyfo3q1vsCipZ6qXZi8rrzEraCnn12ku26wwKeaoqaXYsSqwMdmq6GdXajBor7SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
