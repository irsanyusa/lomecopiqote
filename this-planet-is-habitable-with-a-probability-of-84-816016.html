(Whether that life is&nbsp;intelligent&nbsp;is... let’s say, arguable.) But anyway, it’s not surprising that we’re tirelessly searching for life on&nbsp;other planets. So&nbsp;far, they’ve discovered more than 4,000 of&nbsp;them!</p><p>But what’s even cooler <a href=# title=NASA data-link=tag>NASA</a> has compiled a&nbsp;new list of&nbsp;24&nbsp;planets that aren’t just “Earth-like” ... They’re BETTER. The conditions on&nbsp;them are so&nbsp;good that they’re more comfortable than on&nbsp;our planet! So&nbsp;let’s examine some of&nbsp;them.</p><p>KOI 5715.01. Hmm, let’s be&nbsp;coy (KOI), shall&nbsp;we? This wonderful planet is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the constellation Cygnus. And why is&nbsp;it&nbsp;so&nbsp;wonderful? Well, our <a href=# title=Sun data-link=tag>Sun</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;yellow dwarf. And sorry, Sun&nbsp;— even though you’re not bad at&nbsp;supporting life, there are some stars that can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;better. Nothing personal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9e6/a38/930bde59d9b793c2e486c85947.png><p>The planet KOI-5715.01 orbits near an&nbsp;orange dwarf. Orange dwarfs are stars slightly smaller than our Sun and have a&nbsp;little lower luminosity. Did you like the alliteration, there? Anyway, don’t worry, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean we’re going to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;complete darkness! In&nbsp;fact, if&nbsp;the planet is&nbsp;found closer to&nbsp;the Sun, and it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;thicker <a href=# title=atmosphere data-link=tag>atmosphere</a>, it&nbsp;may even be&nbsp;lighter and more colorful than on&nbsp;Earth!</p><p>Our Sun has a&nbsp;very short lifespan. Right now, it&nbsp;has 7-8 billion years left to&nbsp;live&nbsp;— a&nbsp;little longer than the Earth’s age. But orange dwarfs can live from 45&nbsp;to&nbsp;70&nbsp;billion years! This is&nbsp;great not only because we’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;hang out on&nbsp;this planet longer, but also because the planets around these stars have more time to&nbsp;form life.</p><p>Ideally, we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;planet next to&nbsp;an&nbsp;orange dwarf that is&nbsp;about seven billion years old. It’s very likely that there will be&nbsp;at&nbsp;least SOME organisms there. KOI 5715.01&nbsp;is about 5.5 billion years old. Yeah, it&nbsp;may not seem mature enough, but that’s okay! Neither do&nbsp;I! Our Earth is&nbsp;a&nbsp;billion years younger, and that didn’t stop&nbsp;us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5f3/621/28d1335a3796d2e81b2af38160.png><p>The planet is&nbsp;quite close to&nbsp;its star and is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;habitable zone.&nbsp;1&nbsp;year there lasts 190&nbsp;days... Imagine going to&nbsp;elementary school and already getting a&nbsp;driver’s license. It’s almost two times larger than the Earth. The average temperature there is&nbsp;52°F, which is&nbsp;slightly less than ours (57°F). But it&nbsp;most likely feels warmer there, because strong <a href=# title=gravity data-link=tag>gravity</a> helps it&nbsp;hold onto heat in&nbsp;the atmosphere longer. It’s a&nbsp;little too far away though... Like, 3,000 light-years from Earth. Which is&nbsp;about 18&nbsp;quadrillion miles... Yup, better bring a&nbsp;really big lunch with you. KOI-3010.01. This planet is&nbsp;found next to&nbsp;the star KOI-2010. This planet sounds like a&nbsp;very pleasant world!</p><p>The average temperature on&nbsp;this planet is&nbsp;67°F, so&nbsp;a&nbsp;little warmer than ours. But that’s a&nbsp;good thing! Scientists believe that on&nbsp;a&nbsp;“perfect planet,” the temperature should be&nbsp;just about 10&nbsp;degrees hotter than on&nbsp;the Earth. The more heat there is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the planet, the more comfortable it’s to&nbsp;live there. Also, the higher chances of&nbsp;developing life! The radius of&nbsp;this planet is&nbsp;nearly 1&nbsp;& 1/2 times larger than Earth. There’s some atmosphere, although we’re not yet sure about its composition. But it’s probably like the Earth’s.</p><p>Scientists think that we’ll find an&nbsp;ocean there, and it&nbsp;can cover up&nbsp;to&nbsp;60% of&nbsp;the surface. Which is&nbsp;also cool! In&nbsp;a&nbsp;“perfect world,” water and land should be&nbsp;distributed more evenly than on&nbsp;our planet. A&nbsp;little more land means a&nbsp;little more territory and resources, right? But listen, this planet is&nbsp;actually VERY similar to&nbsp;the Earth. The resemblance is&nbsp;so&nbsp;striking that scientists believe that we&nbsp;have an&nbsp;84% chance to&nbsp;find life there! Of&nbsp;course, not necessarily an&nbsp;intelligent life... But at&nbsp;least some <a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a>. Wouldn’t that be&nbsp;cool?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/953/1c4/47029053e2b9fc1a2dae0577b6.png><p>What do&nbsp;you think they could look like? Hmm, very Earth-like planet, but with stronger gravity... If&nbsp;someone lives there, they’re probably big but have a&nbsp;small height and strong little legs. Sounds adorable and scary. But we&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;find out the truth anytime soon. So&nbsp;far, for&nbsp;us, these planets are microscopic dots in&nbsp;<a href=# title=space data-link=tag>space</a>. We&nbsp;only have some dry, boring data about them, and don’t even know what they look like. We’ll have to&nbsp;wait until we&nbsp;can find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;get closer to&nbsp;these planets.</p><p>Kepler 186f. This is&nbsp;also one of&nbsp;the best candidates for having life. This rather cute planet was nicknamed “the Earth’s cousin” because it&nbsp;does have a&nbsp;strong resemblance. Anyway, these two planets are like sisters, not twins. Kepler 186f rotates near the red dwarf. Red dwarfs are stars even dimmer and smaller than orange dwarfs. Yeah, they’ll also live for a&nbsp;very, very long time, but their luminosity is&nbsp;also quite low.</p><p>However, Kepler-186f is&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;its star than we’re to&nbsp;our Sun, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;shouldn’t be&nbsp;too dark there! Well, at&nbsp;least not night-like dark. The sky on&nbsp;this planet is&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;unusual shade of&nbsp;red, like sunsets on&nbsp;Earth. What do&nbsp;you think? Would you like to&nbsp;live on&nbsp;a&nbsp;planet with an&nbsp;eternal sunset? The size of&nbsp;this planet is&nbsp;about the same as&nbsp;Earth. Not bad, not perfect. Why so? Because the coolest planets are those that are bigger than Earth and have stronger gravity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bd8/01a/e92f44571cb7c75b6df35b4736.png><p>You’ll probably say, “But won’t it&nbsp;be&nbsp;harder to&nbsp;walk there, and even harder to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;bed on&nbsp;Monday?” Of&nbsp;course! But on&nbsp;the other hand, this planet will pull the atmosphere better. The atmosphere will be&nbsp;thicker and denser. This means more protection from the scary space stuff, more <a href=# title=oxygen data-link=tag>oxygen</a>, and more heat. Not to&nbsp;mention the fact that the bigger planets have more space to&nbsp;settle! Awesome, right? But, of&nbsp;course, the Earth’s size is&nbsp;also an&nbsp;excellent choice.</p><p>Another cool fact is&nbsp;that the tilt of&nbsp;Kepler 186f is&nbsp;about the same as&nbsp;ours. It&nbsp;means that there should be&nbsp;stable seasons and a&nbsp;normal day-night cycle. Do&nbsp;you know how important the tilt of&nbsp;the planet&nbsp;is? Let’s look at&nbsp;Mars. Mars is&nbsp;also, in&nbsp;fact, found in&nbsp;the habitable zone of&nbsp;our Sun. But its tilt is&nbsp;very unstable, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the entire ocean that could’ve been on&nbsp;it&nbsp;once now completely dried&nbsp;up.</p><p>Today it’s just a&nbsp;red desert, and there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;life there. At&nbsp;least not as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know... But you see how important these tiny details are? This planet is&nbsp;also quite far away from&nbsp;us&nbsp;— 490 light-years. It’s about 3&nbsp;quadrillion miles. So&nbsp;yeah, we’re just going to&nbsp;keep waiting for intergalactic travel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c43/b9a/efdf7a5c73883cb476f744ab9c.png><p>Kepler 62e and Kepler 62f. These planets were called “the most Earth-like” before we&nbsp;discovered Kepler 186f. They’re very comparable to&nbsp;our home. Kepler 62e is&nbsp;about 1.5 times larger than Earth, and Kepler 62f is&nbsp;just slightly smaller than that.</p><p>They’re located in&nbsp;the constellation Lyra, about 1200 light-years away from&nbsp;us. They both also orbit a&nbsp;red dwarf. One year on&nbsp;Kepler 62e lasts about 122 days&nbsp;— even less than on&nbsp;that first planet we’ve talked about. Scientists believe that both 62e and 62f are sort of&nbsp;“water worlds”&nbsp;— warm places mostly (or&nbsp;even completely) covered with water. If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;land there, it’s probably just some islands.</p><p>A&nbsp;world consisting entirely of&nbsp;islands... a&nbsp;fantasy dream for some (think Hawaii!) and a&nbsp;nightmare for others (think Megalodon!). But if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;ancient marine animals, just imagine how gigantic they could be&nbsp;there! Still there are many things we&nbsp;don’t know about this planet. Does it&nbsp;have a&nbsp;surface? What is&nbsp;its composition? Density?</p><p>One day, maybe we’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;answer these questions. And&nbsp;so, that’s it&nbsp;for the super-Earths. Of&nbsp;course, the original list is&nbsp;much longer, and you can go&nbsp;check it&nbsp;out on&nbsp;the Internet. The best thing about all this is&nbsp;that these are the planets that are BETTER than the Earth... But we&nbsp;also know thousands of&nbsp;other exoplanets that are “just close enough” to&nbsp;ours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3fb/72d/315564514d8182120a6281fe69.png><p>And the odds are, a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;them have at&nbsp;least some form of&nbsp;life! But they’re very, very far away, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;have no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;check it&nbsp;right now... Perhaps down the road, we’ll find some cool creatures on&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGptdJmp6WZnprBbrXSZp%2BampmprqO4xGauoqyYYq5uvNGomZqamaG2tcWMqJ1mcGRihXKCj2ptaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
