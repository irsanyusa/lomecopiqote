I felt myself floating and could not believe my luck that the coolest guy in town found me worthy of dating.</p><p>When I told my friends later, I became the envy of all and many of them tried to dissuade me from dating Toks but I felt they were just jealous of my good fortune.</p><p>Anyways, Toks introduced me to a whole new world and made me see love in a different way. I had read so many romance novels but what I felt for Tokunbo could not be compared to anything I ever read.</p><p>When he deflowered me on my 16th birthday, I made a vow that no man would ever touch me as long as I lived and dedicated myself to him. I loved Tokunbo so much and worshipped the ground he walked.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In fact, the way I felt then, I could have easily denounced my parents if I had to make a choice between them and Toks. I was that crazy about him but looking back now, I know it was all puppy love.</p><p>But Tokunbo took advantage of me and said we should take a blood vow to cement our love and I gladly accepted. That day, he made some incisions on our thumbs, collected the blood which he mixed with some powdery stuff and gin and we drank from it.</p><p>He told me the vow was to bind us together and that anyone that dated or had sex with another person would either run mad or die.</p><p>Stupidly, I went along with him. In my childish mind, I never thought of ever dating or sleeping with another man. Toks was my world and no man could ever come close to him.</p><p>But tragedy struck when Tokunbo was involved in an accident in his final year in the university and died on the spot.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I was 20 then and since he died, I have not been able to have any meaningful relationship with another man as I always fear running mad or lose my life.</p><p>My fear has also been compounded by the fact that when I tried having a relationship some years ago, the man also died in an accident.</p><p>My parents are worried that at 28, I am yet to settle down or even bring a man home to meet them. I have gone for deliverance in different churches but I am still afraid for my life.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Dear readers, having gone through Teniola's story today on Morning Teaser, what do you think she should do to break the blood vow?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miknqyipHyuu9GnoKefXamyor%2FEq2Shp6disbB5yGaZq52RoHqiecGlpqicXaSutbSMomStp5%2Bgeri106FkprFdoa61sYybprKeop6yr7COpJpspZxstQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
