Check out his amazing <a href=#>Blind Audition</a> in the video below, and read on to find out what the coaches had to say about his performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfQg9wdgy4k</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-victor-solomon-auditions-for-the-voice>Victor Solomon Auditions For ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Blake Shelton was the first The Voice coach to turn his chair for Victor’s performance. John Legend was the next to turn around, followed by Nick Jonas. Kelly Clarkson didn’t hit her button.</p><p>After his performance, Victor shared that he’s 22 years old and attends North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the No. 1 public HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) in America.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW CONTESTANTS ON ‘THE VOICE’ SEASON 20</a></strong></p><p>Blake couldn’t believe Victor was so young, adding that he has an “old man voice.” He tried to convince the singer that he could coach gospel artists, but John noted that he didn’t even realize it was his song.</p><p>Kelly thought it was hilarious that Blake didn’t recognize John’s song, which he won an Oscar for. It was featured in the 2014 movie Selma, depicting the 1965&nbsp;Selma to Montgomery marches led by Martin Luther King Jr.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-john-legend-think-of-the-audition>What Did John Legend Think Of The Audition?</h3><p>“I knew an angel wrote that song,” Blake said when Kelly called him out for not recognizing the track. Kelly, meanwhile, said she didn’t turn around because she didn’t think she had a chance.</p><p>John told Victor that he co-wrote the song with Common and Rhymefest to “evoke the hymns that we grew up listening to.” He pointed out that he has never turned his chair for someone singing one of his songs. “I scrutinize it more heavily than I normally would,” he explained.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>WATCH ‘THE VOICE’ COACHES CELEBRATE 10 YEARS OF THE SHOW IN EPIC WAY</a></strong></p><p>The coach added that Victor did things with the song that were “better” than his version. Victor said he grew up singing John’s songs, and won a talent show with “Ordinary People.”</p><p>When John heard that, he grabbed his microphone and performed a quick duet of the song with Victor. You might expect that Victor would choose John as his coach, but he actually said he wants to “shake things up.” Find out who he chooses during Monday’s The Voice premiere at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Voice-Season-20-coaches-.jpeg alt="What Time Does ‘The Voice’ Season 20 Premiere And How To Watch It?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>john legend</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaifp2WcmrSmusNmm66dpKh6uLXToWStoJViw7C1wp5kmqqknsC1edahpmarkaO0brTIrGSsp56cere1w56maA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
