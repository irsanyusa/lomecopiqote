The young singer suffering from cystic fibrosis was given a life expectancy of 35 years old. Cystic fibrosis limits the ability to breathe over time.&nbsp;He decided early on never to take a day for granted and is still living by that today.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-alum-kayden-stephenson-drops-debut-single-and-gives-a-health-update>‘American Idol’ Alum Kayden Stephenson Drops Debut Single and Gives a Health Update</h2><p>With his debut single “Rodéo” out now, Kayden hopes to burst onto the music scene. The song definitely has similar vibes to Justin Bieber’s “Peaches” which went viral on TikTok. Hopefully “Rodéo” sees the same results. It has already been added to Spotify’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Fresh Finds Playlist.</a> This song proves that Kayden has come such a long way from when he sang “I Wish” by Stevie Wonder for his American Idol audition. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicki Minaj</a> even said she was inspired by Kayden’s positive attitude.</p><p>He posted that a new breakthrough in medicine called Trikafta has helped him live his life normally. Before the medicine, Kayden was put on the list for a double lung transplant. Kayden used to find himself in the hospital every three months for two weeks at a time. He has not been there in two years.</p><p>“I grew up being told my average life expectancy would be 35 and that is no longer the case,” he wrote on Instagram. “It feels like I’m living through a paradigm shift. I never talk about this topic bc ppl can sometimes focus on it too much when there’s so much more to me than that. Especially now. I take my music and passions seriously. Your support means everything. Thank you all!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Kayden has made his goals clear on his Instagram page with 145,000 followers. He moved back to Los Angeles and knows that reaching success is a process that happens over time.</p><p>“All I want to do in this life is build a big enough online presence so that I can talk to the ppl & the ppl will listen,” he wrote. “That’s when u can truly make big change here on Earth. Music is just a form of doing that for me along with some other things.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NUP_193480_12203.jpeg alt="The Season 16 ‘AGT’ Contestants Who Have Competed on Other Talent Shows" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqwnZ2eYsC1sc%2BhnKern6N6qbvPnqpmrJ9is6q6w2aqrpuTmsC0edaiq6FllJqvtsCMrKCnn5yaerO7w56mZpmWqbKzecCmnKuhk5a7brXDqKNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
