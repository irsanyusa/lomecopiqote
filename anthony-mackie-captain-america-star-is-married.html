I was coming from a very bad school and going to a very good school, and when I walked into second grade it was Dr. Seuss Day, and we had the little hot plate out and the teacher was making green eggs and ham. So I walk in, and I looked and I see this little girl with these ratty pigtails and skinny legs, and I was like WOW!”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Concerning the wedding, a source who attended the wedding shared, “it was low-key and super-relaxed, they had a welcome dinner. We golfed and drank. They went on a honeymoon soon after.”</p><p>Although the actor has not confirmed any of this,he has been spotted wearing a very blingy wedding band on that finger as seen in the picture above.</p><p>Their union sounds like a match made in heaven and we wish them all best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7wKeroaeernqurcKkoJ5lk5a9ta3Ip2SapZWntqStjKyrmqpdnsBuucCrqaKdlGTBs4TDq6%2Bb</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
