The refund of the bride price is proof that the marriage is over.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If the husband does not accept the refund of the bride price, then it is a case for the council of elders, Ndi Ichie to handle. In some cases, the matter is taken to a customary or native court.</p><p>Under Igbo culture, a woman cannot own a life. It is believed that her life belongs to her husband or father and as such the children are not hers.</p><p>There is no argument or debate about who the child or children should be with because the child belongs to the man, except he didn't pay the bride price during the marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cL7En6ynnJmjtG6u0aKbnmWgp7aksYyipWahl5e8bq%2FUrKuopV9sgXm%2F2XGc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
