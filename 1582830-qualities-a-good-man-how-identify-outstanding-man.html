However, finding a quality man is like hitting the jackpot, as they are a rare breed—not all men possess them. Therefore, views on the qualities of a good man to marry or date below are subjective and vary greatly. This piece reflects a singular perspective and should not be considered a universal standard.</p><h2 id=1582830-qualities-of-a-good-man class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Qualities of a good man</h2><p class=align-left>What qualities define a good man? Once you know the qualities and traits to look for, you <a href=#>can</a> eliminate the bad from the good and make the right choice. Below is a list of qualities to look out for when dating.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0879a42b3d4ffe67.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"How can I get my crush to fall in love with me?"

Commitment-minded</h3><p class=align-left>One of the qualities of a good man in a relationship is commitment-oriented. A good guy is ready to commit to you. He should not be the type to string you along and waste your time.</p><p class=align-left>From the beginning, he will let you know he wants to be exclusive and <a id=https://www.bustle.com/articles/179103-13-ways-to-talk-about-the-future-with-your-partner-in-a-way-that-isnt-scary href=# rel="nofollow noopener">discuss the future </a>with you. A commitment-phobic man does the opposite, as he doesn't make plans ahead and makes you feel like you are not his priority.</p><h3 id=1582830-2-vulnerable class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. Vulnerable</h3><p class=align-left>Although men don't like showing their emotions, a good guy should be able to put aside his ego and be vulnerable with you. He should be comfortable enough to express his feelings and thoughts to you. This will make you understand each other better, and you will be able to know his strengths and weaknesses.</p><h3 id=1582830-3-he-supports-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. He supports you</h3><p class=align-left>One clear sign that you have a high-value man is that he supports you. This could be through your study, work, business or career. A guy who shows up for you and motivates you to achieve your dreams is a keeper. It means he wants you to succeed at everything you do.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/17541721fac812e5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is a high value man? Their character traits and how to become one</span></p></a><h3 id=1582830-4-emotionally-available class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Emotionally available</h3><p class=align-left>When choosing a man to date or marry, you are looking for someone who will be there for you emotionally and physically. Emotional support is one of a man's most essential forms of support. He should be able to show you love and affection and offer a shoulder to lean on.</p><p class=align-left>If he exhibits hot and cold behaviour, he is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">emotionally unavailable</a>. However, he is emotionally available if he is comfortable sharing his personal life with you and allows you to discuss issues.</p><h3 id=1582830-5-respectful class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. Respectful</h3><p class=align-left>Respect is paramount in any relationship, whether platonic or romantic. Any form of disrespect from a man is a red flag. Pick the respectful one when looking for a man to marry or date. A high-quality man respects himself and the <a href=#>people</a> around him.</p><p class=align-left>There are various ways a guy could show that he respects you. It could be by valuing your <a href=#>opinion</a>, treating you right in public and private, respecting your loved ones, etc.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/61392ca26f953949.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best one-liners to get a laugh out of your friends or crush</span></p></a><h3 id=1582830-6-kind-and-loving class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>6. Kind and loving</h3><p class=align-left>A kind and loving man is a keeper. Kindness and genuine love go hand in hand and are among the bare minimum qualities of a good man. Kindness is seen in how he treats people around him, including those with a lesser status. A kind guy is compassionate and will never do anything to hurt you.</p><h3 id=1582830-7-good-communicator class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>7. Good communicator</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0879a42b3d4ffe67.jpg><p class=align-left>Communication is an integral component of a relationship. A healthy relationship is where couples find <a href=#>things to talk about</a> and communicate effectively. If you date someone poor in communication, there will be a lot of narcissistic traits and passive-aggressive behaviours.</p><h3 id=1582830-8-trustworthiness class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>8. Trustworthiness</h3><p class=align-left>You hit a jackpot if you find a trustworthy man. Trustworthiness is one of the qualities of a good guy when it comes to dating. This is because the trait encompasses many traits, such as honesty and integrity.</p><p class=align-left>Characteristics of a trustworthy guy include consistency, reliability, and dependability. You must have a trustworthy guy if you intend to have kids with him, as you are sure he will treat them well.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0f7ca38270931d92.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ compliments for men to bring a smile to their face</span></p></a><h3 id=1582830-9-faithful class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>9. Faithful</h3><p class=align-left>This is perhaps the most considered quality of a man every lady seeks. You have struck gold if you have a faithful man, as they are rare. A faithful guy is one whose loyalty to you doesn't waver. Whether in good or bad times, he stands by you and always chooses you no matter what.</p><h3 id=1582830-10-romantic class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>10. Romantic</h3><p class=align-left>Romance is the main spice of a successful love relationship and helps to <a href=#>keep things exciting</a>. A good guy should be romantic and should always find ways to show you affection. Romance is more than just physical gestures; it involves loving, serving, and expressing what he feels on the inside.</p><h3 id=1582830-11-generous class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>11. Generous</h3><p class=align-left>There is nothing as tiring as being involved with a mean guy. A good man is generous with his love and material wealth. He loves sharing his time and meeting the needs of others. A generous guy will want to buy you gifts, assist in any need, and offer you treats occasionally.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1a77f3daed58e65a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75+ inspirational quotes for men to set them on the right path</span></p></a><h3 id=1582830-12-sense-of-humor class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>12. Sense of humor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/17541721fac812e5.png><p class=align-left>A sense of humour comes on top of the list of qualities of a good man. Your man should be able to crack <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1204924-best-funny-jokes-girls.html href=#>funny jokes</a> and make you laugh even when you don't feel like laughing. A good sense of humour can brighten a gloomy day and diffuse tension.</p><h3 id=1582830-13-confident class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>13. Confident</h3><p class=align-left>Confidence is one of the key qualities of a high-value man. You want a guy who believes in himself and is comfortable in his skin. He knows how to balance between confidence and ego and is not abrasive.</p><h3 id=1582830-14-goal-oriented class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>14. Goal-oriented</h3><p class=align-left>A man with goals that he sets out to achieve is a keeper. Having goals shows that he is trying to improve himself and his circumstances. It is also a demonstration that he faces life head-on and doesn't take life lying down. A goal-oriented man is bound to win because he has a vision.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/60a8e66c1565c224.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to compliment a girl: 50+ ways to make a lady feel special</span></p></a><h3 id=1582830-15-a-good-man-likes-to-show-you-off class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>15. A good man likes to show you off</h3><p class=align-left>When a guy finds someone he likes, he loves to show them off. Therefore, a good man will want to show you off to his loved one to make you <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1168508-touching-love-messages-girlfriend.html href=#>feel loved</a>. He will be looking forward to taking you places where he knows people can see you.</p><h3 id=1582830-16-should-responsible class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>16. Should responsible</h3><p class=align-left>Responsibility is one of the crucial characteristics of a good man. Dating an irresponsible guy is nothing but trouble. If a guy is often cluings, doesn't take care of himself and doesn't take responsibility for himself, he is in a no-go zone.</p><h3 id=1582830-17-motivates-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>17. Motivates you</h3><p class=align-left>Everyone needs a little motivation in life, and a relationship is no different. When choosing a man to date, look for the one who motivates you. He should lead by example and be able to encourage you to keep pushing on your dreams.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/52baf77206fcdf36.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a conversation with a guy: best openers to try out</span></p></a><h3 id=1582830-18-he-is-a-good-listener class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>18.
