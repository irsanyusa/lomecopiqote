All I can say is, if he ever comes to the U.S. I might as well pack up my bags and go.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1955 Emil Gilels came with full ruffles and flourishes as the first top Russian artist to perform in the U.S. since Composer Sergei Prokofiev’s visit in 1921. Now, at 48, Gilels (pronounced Gill-ells) is back for his fifth tour of the U.S. and playing better than ever.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His visits, in fact, comprise a case study in the evolution of a good pianist into one of the great masters of our day. Isolated within one school of music, in this case the Russian, the growth potential of an artist such as Gilels was, like a sapling in a tin can, limited. But with a decade of exposure to the crosscurrents of Western musical life, Gilels has spread his roots and matured to a remarkable degree since his U.S. debut. His attack has become more assured. Once objective and calculating, he now plunges deeply into a work with daring abandon, searches out its mysteries, takes chances. A fireplug of a man with square, stubby hands, Gilels foregoes note-picking accuracy for a more fluid style of fingering.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At mid-tour Gilels has drawn rapturous acclaim wherever he has appeared. At Chicago’s Orchestra Hall the overflow crowd spilled onto the stage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gilels rewarded them with a magnificent performance of his tour de force, Liszt’s massively difficult Sonata in B Minor. Last week at Seattle’s Opera House, the audience awarded Gilels one standing ovation after another.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gilels, a professor of music at Moscow University, was genuinely touched by the size and fervor of his audiences. Especially, he said, since “Americans have stereo, hi-fi and the best of records. Still they come to the concert hall. The recordings to them are like canned food. A concert is like fresh food.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vamxiZYZwvMiapaKrpKh6tbTEZpyvp5yqwaq7zWamn2WVoratew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
