A&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> found that words and phrases can have different meanings to&nbsp;each of&nbsp;us when we’re talking. This is&nbsp;why, sometimes, we&nbsp;can’t <a href=# title=communicate data-link=tag>communicate</a> without getting into an&nbsp;argument, raising our voice, or&nbsp;throwing some pillows (sorry, guys). But if&nbsp;you’re willing to&nbsp;put in&nbsp;some mental effort, you can learn how to&nbsp;communicate better with each other and save yourself some misunderstandings, tears, and sighs in&nbsp;the long run, with just a&nbsp;little <a href=# title=psychology data-link=tag>psychology</a>.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> is&nbsp;here with 12&nbsp;pieces of&nbsp;advice to&nbsp;help you have a&nbsp;smoother relationship with your boss, your parent, or&nbsp;your significant other.</p><p><h2>1. Women: Don’t read between the lines.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c0/74c/6223d855e28c882406279f29c1.jpg><p>There’s <a href=#>evidence</a> that women read more into interpersonal meaning in&nbsp;messages with their mates. In&nbsp;other words, they tend to&nbsp;“read between the lines,” and attribute values of&nbsp;<a href=# title=intimacy data-link=tag>intimacy</a> and closeness to&nbsp;their partner’s words. On&nbsp;the other hand, men are more literal and might just expect the center of&nbsp;that conversation to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;subject.</p><p>One example would be&nbsp;our illustration above. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;says “We&nbsp;have the semifinals today!” he&nbsp;means that. He&nbsp;doesn’t mean “I’d rather be&nbsp;with my&nbsp;friends, you’re boring!”</p><p>Understanding what each other wants out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;conversation in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship will help bridge the differences. This objective translation will also allow each member to&nbsp;feel cherished in&nbsp;the relationship. More on&nbsp;that later...</p><p><h2>2. Men: Don’t advise, just listen.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fd/41e/75723f554d82ac4909cece0906.jpg><p>Ah! The common “You just don’t get&nbsp;it...” Well, maybe it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;more like, “You just don’t understand why.”</p><p>Women tend to&nbsp;<a href=#>see</a> communication as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;explore feelings and feel comforted by&nbsp;their partners. AKA: She’s not looking for a&nbsp;solution! It’s more about the journey and conversation itself that matters for her. On&nbsp;the polar opposite side... men have a&nbsp;tendency to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;clear solutions, healthy advice, and they want to&nbsp;deliver it&nbsp;as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;possible. Because of&nbsp;this, couples can gain from just getting a&nbsp;better understanding of&nbsp;what the other is&nbsp;looking for. He&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;give advice, but she just wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;heard.</p><p><h2>3. Women: Appreciate that he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;comfort you.<br>Men: Act like you care.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ff/050/e15f3d500188931e2767f1dd1d.jpg><p>Men will see a&nbsp;problem that needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;solved and show care for their partner by&nbsp;putting their energy into solving the problem for her. This means he&nbsp;will get analytical, explore different problem-solving tactics, and try to&nbsp;communicate them to&nbsp;her.</p><p>Meanwhile, she’s really just looking for an&nbsp;attentive listener. The man could really <a href=#>help</a> his relationship by&nbsp;asking heartfelt questions in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;understand her better and make sure she feels like she’s being listened&nbsp;to (perhaps via some nonverbal cues).</p><p><h2>4. Women: Understand that men also enjoy some “quality me-time.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b56/8b8/66725b5366bfec03ee33e16442.jpg><p>Men are often accused of&nbsp;being uncommunicative or&nbsp;withdrawn, and on&nbsp;the surface, this may appear true. But women might have a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;gain from understanding the reasons for this <a href=#>behavior</a>.</p><p>If&nbsp;your man seems a&nbsp;little bit isolated, this likely means that he’s just taking a&nbsp;quick break from his problems. This mini-vacay may take on&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a&nbsp;marathon of&nbsp;video games, watching&nbsp;TV, or&nbsp;reading. Don’t fret about it&nbsp;— just give him his space! And make sure to&nbsp;make him feel like everything is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alright by&nbsp;letting him know that you trust that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;things.</p><p><h2>5. Women: Try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more clear about your intentions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/378/a34/097a7756089d4985c3544fb70f.jpg><p>Women and men are different in&nbsp;how they say things to&nbsp;one and other. Women are a&nbsp;bit more indirect than men, tend to&nbsp;avoid direct accusations, and might prefer to&nbsp;launch indirect allegations instead.<br>So&nbsp;it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;best for women to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more <a href=#>precise</a> with their man and for him to&nbsp;delve a&nbsp;bit deeper into what exactly they are actually discussing.</p><p>For example, she might not say, “I’m mad about what you said at&nbsp;dinner last night.” Instead, she might opt for a&nbsp;sarcastic remark such&nbsp;as, “Maybe you should think about being nicer during our dates.” When this happens, you might both be&nbsp;arguing about or&nbsp;defending different things.</p><p><h2>6. Men: Make sure she knows you’re listening by&nbsp;giving feedback.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78d/a40/c3304055d18ea8742b01899403.jpg><p>Partners <a href=#>differ</a> in&nbsp;their communication styles via verbal responses, physical contact, and eye contact. Generally, men won’t place much stress on&nbsp;reaffirming his partner that he’s listening via eye contact or&nbsp;other verbal cues like, “aha... oh... well... yes...”. On&nbsp;the other hand, women place a&nbsp;strong emphasis on&nbsp;this constant feedback to&nbsp;assure themselves and those they’re speaking to&nbsp;that that both parties are engaged in&nbsp;the conversation. Humming might go&nbsp;a&nbsp;long way if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;guy!</p><p><h2>7. Women: Try seeing a&nbsp;task as&nbsp;just a&nbsp;task.<br>Men: Add some romanticism into the task itself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/011/885/329a75519cb9b7a8b39e12878b.jpg><p>Women engage themselves by&nbsp;building trust first through talking and then participating in&nbsp;tasks together, that they will accomplish because of&nbsp;that trust. Men tend to&nbsp;dismiss this trust chat and instead rush straight into the mission of&nbsp;accomplishing a&nbsp;task. For example: If&nbsp;they need to&nbsp;work with their boss, they’ll do&nbsp;it&nbsp;even if&nbsp;they don’t like her.</p><p>Both <a href=#>parties</a> stand to&nbsp;gain from taking a&nbsp;step back and seeing the way their significant other behaves, and always acting with additional empathy. They both may have the same objective in&nbsp;mind, but different ways and speeds of&nbsp;getting there!</p><p><h2>8. Women: Understand that men often need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;doing something while they chat.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0b/d49/e59b445968829aec43028a47f5.jpg><p>Men tend to&nbsp;communicate while doing, and the activity itself is&nbsp;central to&nbsp;fostering a&nbsp;feeling that they can open up&nbsp;emotionally. Meanwhile, women feel closer while speaking&nbsp;— they can go&nbsp;without the need for a&nbsp;secondary activity. Recognizing <a href=#>this</a> may help women understand when their partner seeks to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something before, or&nbsp;even in&nbsp;the middle&nbsp;of, an&nbsp;argument. He&nbsp;might just be&nbsp;seeking out a&nbsp;better environment to&nbsp;discuss the issue, while she’s trying to&nbsp;discuss everything right now!</p><p><h2>9. Men: Don’t hesitate to&nbsp;ask for help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9bb/d56/42134a56049e69ad8a4f3f3e3e.jpg><p>They may perceive that the need to&nbsp;ask for help is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reflection of&nbsp;their inability to&nbsp;achieve something. Meanwhile, for women, offering advice is&nbsp;perceived as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;caring for someone else. To&nbsp;bridge this <a href=#>gap</a>, it&nbsp;may help to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;clear as&nbsp;possible about your intentions, rather than to&nbsp;allow the other person to&nbsp;just assume that you’re seeking to&nbsp;help as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;pointing out their weakness to&nbsp;them. Yikes!</p><p>So, as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example, let’s take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the illustration above. Imagine he’s on&nbsp;his computer trying to&nbsp;solve a&nbsp;problem. Don’t just say, “You’re doing it&nbsp;wrong, you need my&nbsp;help.” Try saying instead, “I’ve had that bug before, want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;check and see if&nbsp;I can fix&nbsp;it?”</p><p><h2>10. Women: Realize that men are selective listeners.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/86d/cc0/61982b5f1898a49bfea89c6b58.jpg><p>They’re what we&nbsp;call “<a href=#>selective</a> listeners.” This point ties into the previous point about men seeking to&nbsp;solve problems&nbsp;— they’ll only listen long enough to&nbsp;ask as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;they deem necessary in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;solution. On&nbsp;the other hand, women show greater appreciation for verbal and non-verbal cues and may be&nbsp;offended if&nbsp;these 2&nbsp;are not present.</p><p><h2>11. Women: Don’t let your anger accumulate.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/464/dc0/3dcabb5ecb8393fa2e1903653d.jpg><p>Men “compartmentalize,” while women see each argument as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;greater whole. In&nbsp;other words, men are perfectly fine having an&nbsp;argument on&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular subject, letting it&nbsp;go, and moving on&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;second subject without much thought about the former argument lingering in&nbsp;their minds. Whereas a&nbsp;woman is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;carry her anger over onto the next item on&nbsp;the list. It&nbsp;may for help both to&nbsp;understand that this isn’t just her “not letting it&nbsp;go” or&nbsp;him “forgetting about&nbsp;it.” Instead, both members of&nbsp;the relationship simply <a href=#>understand</a> problems and the relationships between them differently.</p><p><h2>12. Women and men: Welcome your partner’s communication style.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39e/056/5390ae536ab8912ba17124caae.jpg><p>Although almost all of&nbsp;us have succumbed to&nbsp;the previous points, it’s also important to&nbsp;acknowledge that different people (regardless of&nbsp;their gender) have different communication styles. Some may be&nbsp;more competitive communicators, be&nbsp;okay with challenges, and be&nbsp;direct in&nbsp;their communication. Others may be&nbsp;more affiliative communicators, meaning they fall into the group of&nbsp;people who enjoy asking others for feedback, they like listening to&nbsp;all sides, and they generally avoid conflict. So, remember, your partner is&nbsp;also unique.</p><p>How do&nbsp;you understand guys more easily?
