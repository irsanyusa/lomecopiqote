According to her, "My parents were very poor or rather, they became poor because of some unforeseen circumstances. My father told me that when I was born, people gathered in our house to cry, wondering why he should give birth to a baby girl."</p><p>She continued, "I can't remember what my mother didn't sell in her lifetime and it ranged from oranges, maize to pounded yam. I hawked so much that I still have a scar at the center of my head to show for it. When my brother was ill, we sold all the plates in the house. So, my mother would pound cocoyam and put it in my palms (where I fed on). The reason why today I hate mushrooms (my mum plucked them from a neighboring farm) is because we couldn't afford meat or fish."</p><p>Despite her background, she managed to go to school. As you can imagine, it wasn't always easy to pay her fees but she persevered.</p><p>"While in school, I remember those days when I would not be able to pay my school fees, even though I was the head girl in my school then. I had to wait for about two weeks before I could go back to school. My father had to do some menial jobs to be able to raise my school fees. Eventually, I graduated from school," she said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She was later able to fund her university education with the help of her husband, Pastor <strong>Felix Adejumo.</strong></p><p>Faith & Ministry</p><p>Rev Adejumo became a born-again Christian at the age of 14.</p><p>In her words, "At 14, I gave my life to Jesus and that was when my life witnessed a turnaround and it has been getting better and better."</p><p>Years later after marrying her husband, the two started the <strong>Agape Christian Ministries</strong> in August 1988. From having only two families at its first service on August 7, 1988,&nbsp; the ministry has grown to over 30 branches located all over Nigeria.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Speaking with Punch, she revealed, "Meanwhile, when my husband started his ministry, we used to live in Ibadan before God told him that we should relocate to another place. Later, I moved to Ondo State in 1987, and there we started the Agape Christian Ministries in August 1988. Today, by the grace of God, we have about 33 branches of the church scattered all over the country. We just opened the 34th branch at Lekki, Lagos."</p><p>Apart from the church, Rev Adejumo is also the president of <strong>Funke Felix Adejumo Foundation </strong>who believes her divine purpose is "honoring God and blessing humanity".</p><p>She does this through her foundation, Grace Orphanage, and her outreach programs.</p><p>According to her, "When I see widows go home with food, my husband and I are thankful to God. We recently commissioned a home for abused and battered women because I am tired of women being killed."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She has authored over 50 books with titles like<strong> "Fifty Lessons Life Taught Me," "My Seed is Designed for the Palace",</strong> and<strong> "Mothers Summit Prayer Points."</strong></p><p>Money 'wahala'</p><p>Recently, Rev Adejumo has faced heavy criticism for asking people to give huge amounts in order to reap God's blessings. It all started about a week when a video of the popular preacher asking <a href=# id=f84ab5f7-37aa-5a66-bad7-b5d6335776ee>20 people to sow a seed of $1000</a> (N365, 000) hit the internet.</p><p>"I want 20 people to sow a seed of $1000 dollars each," she says before promising "another level of clean money and surprise wealth."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This was followed by another controversy after rumors of her offering <a href=# id=ceb96ce5-f522-5689-a422-50570b56a9ee>'virginity anointing' for a price</a> circulated online. She immediately shut the news down with disclaimers via her social media accounts.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, a video was shared online the next day, July 11, 2018, which earned her severe backlash.</p><p>Sadly, more clips of her asking parents to sow a seed of $100 to $1000 on behalf of their children have been shared online. Her theory is that sowing these seeds will result in blessings and divine financial prosperity.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>These videos have made her the target of heavy criticism from social media users and well-known religious critic, Daddy Freeze.</p><p>She is yet to respond to any of the negative backlash.</p><p>Personal life</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She is married to Bishop Felix 'Remi Adejumo, whom she met while schooling at the<strong> University of Ibadan</strong> in 1982. She agreed to marry him on September 8, 1982, and they tied the knot on September 8, 1984.</p><p>Describing her husband in an interview with Punch, she said, "Fantastic man of God. I'm tempted to call him an angel but I know he's not because he's human. He's a very secure man who believes that you can rise and allow others to rise too.</p><p>"He once told me that I should not allow myself to die under his shadow. He also said to me that there is so much from my inside that my generation is waiting for; and that as I'm helping him, he also will help me. I wish that all husbands are like my husband. He has his own shortcomings as a human being. But if I get to heaven and there is another opportunity for me, I will marry him again."</p><p>Their union is blessed with four children, at least five grandchildren, and many adopted children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8s7HVZp2uppuaeqKwxKOspqddlrmtediorGamlZqxbsDOZqKnp6dirqO71K1kqaegqrmivoyfnKaZnJp6sb7EmpqhnaJkhHa9j5twbg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
