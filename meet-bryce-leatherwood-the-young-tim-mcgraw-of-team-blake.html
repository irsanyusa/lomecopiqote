As one of the singers representing Team Blake on The Voice, Bryce is someone who gets better and better with each passing day.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Bryce Leatherwood From Team Blake?</h2><p>Bryce is a Georgia Southern grad with a passion for country music, ahead of the season he was eager to showcase his skills on The Voice stage. Apart from having a powerful but soothing voice, Bryce is also a very religious man with a soft spot for his family.</p><p>The 22-year-old lives by a wholesome philosophy of loving and caring for his family, especially his grandfather who battled lung cancer.&nbsp;His grandfather initially refused to go through chemotherapy, but eventually decided to go through to treatment for Bryce. Although his grandfather has since been in remission, Bryce plans to make him proud by becoming a well-known singer.</p><p>Even though the 22 year old recently finished college, he has no plan to look for a full time job. Instead, he is following his dream of singing for a living and owning a farm in the country. <a href=# class=broken_link>The budding singer</a> sees Blake Shelton as his mentor and looks up to him as his inspiration.</p><p>Bryce also plays gigs together with his band named Bryce Leatherwood Band in numerous studios around Woodstock. He has set his sights on becoming a country superstar and his run on The Voice is the next step to music stardom.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-is-a-sensation-on-the-voice>He is a Sensation on The Voice</h2><p>Bryce is a perfect example of a singer from Team Blake. <a href=#>Country-style singing</a> and a voice that can match iconic singers from the genre are the best qualities Shelton looks for. The fact has been proven true when during Bryce’s Blind Audition, he didn’t even have to hit the chorus before Shelton turned his chair.</p><p>It is obvious who Bryce would pick as his coach, even though two other coaches also turned their chairs. Shelton was indeed delighted to have a singer that can hit the two hard notes of the song become a part of his team.</p><p>Throughout his performances on The Voice, Bryce has proven that he is the “real deal,” that fans hope for him to be. If Shelton and the fans see the potential for Bryce to be like country music superstar Tim McGraw, then he is surely going to make it to the finale.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_GabbyWindey_ValChmerkovskiy_ABC_Eric-McCandless-220x176.jpg alt="Gabby Windey Hints That She’ll Address Break-Up on ‘Dancing with the Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWSp8aksYylnJqsmJq%2FuLvOnWStoJVixrDBzaBkraGdYrqks9GarmanlmLBpq3MZpmlmZuafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
