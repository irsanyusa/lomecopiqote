Pulse recently caught up with the model for a chat about overcoming first-timer challenges on a production like 'Blood and Water'.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>What was your experience like on the show as a first-time actor</strong></p><p>“I think for me as a first-timer and newcomer, it took me some time to get familiar with everything. Kind of like my character Sam, coming to the Parkhurst scene as a new kid, I also felt like a new kid coming onto the scene. The cast members already knowing each other and having shared experiences from season one. So, I definitely had to find my ground but everyone was very welcoming and warm and that definitely helped me to just feel comfortable to express myself.”</p><p><strong>What challenges did you struggle with embodying the character Sam</strong></p><p>“I would say that I'm really similar to my character Sam. So I think it was a bit difficult to try and maintain being within character and being myself<strong> </strong>and kind of separate the two and at the end of the day being honest and true to Sam as Sam is a total individual to I am.</p><p>"I also had to learn a few skills which was all fun. I had to ride a bike, how to surf and much more. The experience as a whole was just absolutely amazing. It was a great experience and obviously, the best part of it was really just like channeling something new from within that I had not, that I didn't even know existed and getting in to tap into emotions that I didn't realize I had.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>What is your fondest memory of filming 'Blood and Water' season two?</strong></p><p>“I would personally say just forming good friendships with everyone and I think more than just being able to portray this character that I really love and adore so much and just having fun from it. Even the friendships outside of filming is something I really loved and enjoyed about filming ‘Blood & Water’ and forming great alliances with everyone, cast and crew.</p><p>'Blood and Water' is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8o7jOqJtmmZ6Zerit056pZqSVp7y6edKisJqekWLBorjKrGSmmZueu6h5wJyroqaXYrGmrtStZKKmXam1pnnNnqufpJmterSx0aKcrGdkr8Opgtig</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
