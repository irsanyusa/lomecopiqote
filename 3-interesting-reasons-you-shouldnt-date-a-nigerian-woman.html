It is in fact, to give you complaining folks reasons to leave us alone. Do you have a particular notion of Nigerian women due to the way the media has painted them? Well, I'm here to buttress a few of those notions about Nigerian women. I would give you some more reasons why you should absolutely, unequivocally, never even contemplate the idea of dating a Nigerian woman. I mean, come on - a woman from the green-and-white flagged country? Hard pass.</p><p>So, without further unnecessary ado, here are three quirky reasons that should discourage you from dating a Nigerian woman (wink, wink).</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>She's a great cook</h3></p><p>What? She cooks well? What effrontery! I mean who wants a partner that's great at cooking and can whip up delicious meals from scratch? Certainly not you right? Nigerian women have a reputation for their great cooking skills, cue Hilda Baci, who turns simple dishes into a masterpiece.</p><p>But honestly, who needs that kind of sweetness and enjoyment in their life? So, if you're really against the idea of a good home-cooked meal with lots of love, then please, by all means, avoid dating a Nigerian woman.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>She truly cares and is supportive</h3></p><p>Who in their right mind would want a partner who actually cares about their well-being? Nigerian women take care of their men and genuinely support their hustle. They are the embodiment of strength and a typical woman-behind-every-successful-man. They're listeners, take care of their families and are God-oriented.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But come on, who needs someone who will stand by your side through thick and thin? If you're looking for a shallow relationship void of emotional intimacy and love, then, avoid dating a Nigerian woman. They are definitely not the ones for you.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>She's family-oriented</h3></p><p>Nigerian women prioritise family, respect traditions, and place a high value on building meaningful connections with those around them. Now, who in their right mind would want that kind of relationship?</p><p>If you're aiming for a life of isolation and detachment, definitely don't date a Nigerian woman. Nigerian women are notorious for valuing family ties and wanting to build a good home for themselves in future with a loving partner. You, on the other hand, do not have time for a beautiful home filled with love and laughter.</p><p>Nigerian women are ambitious, goal-driven, family-oriented, determined and of course, they love enjoyment. These women pursue their dreams with tenacity and achieve impressive goals both within our borders and on the international stage.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>See the likes of inspirational Nigerian women such as<strong> Chimamanda Adichie, Tems, Aisha Yesufu, Rinu, Hilda Baci, Beverly Naya</strong> and countless other exceptional Nigerian women, who exceed the boundaries of this narrative.</p><p>But seriously, who really wants a partner passionate about personal growth and success? If you'd rather prefer a couch potato who's allergic to ambition, then steer clear of Nigerian women.</p><p>Okay, I’m kidding!</p><p>You've just been schooled in the art of reverse psychology. Yea, I've playfully highlighted 'reasons' not to date a Nigerian woman, the actual truth is that these qualities and more are why you should consider yourself lucky if you ever find yourself in a relationship with one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7kmagp6yVp7K0wMinnmaqlZbAsLrSZrCorV2otbDBy52lrWWUlsGmecBmpaKflae2orqMsKammZ5kx3jFzG6apA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
