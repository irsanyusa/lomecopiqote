YNAB is a zero-based budgeting platform, meaning you give every dollar a job, whether that’s monthly household expenses, debt payoff, savings, or investments.</p><p>After a 34-day free trial, YNAB costs $14.99 per month or $99 per year (which comes out to $8.25 per month). It’s primarily a web-based application, best for laptop and desktop computers. There’s also a helpful mobile app for Android and iOS to manage your finances on the go.</p><h3>2. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Empower</a></h3><h3 class=product-title>Empower</h3><p>Fees</p><p>0.89% or less</p><p>Free Trial</p><p>Free to use</p><p>Platform</p><p>Web, iOS, Android</p><p>Import from Quicken</p><p>No</p><p><a rel=alternate href=#>Empower</a> is a personal finance tracking app that’s primarily focused on investments. While helpful budgeting features are available, the most powerful features are related to tracking your investments. Various views help you break down your investments to better understand your asset allocation, fees, portfolio risk, retirement-planning status, and more.</p><p>The <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Empower</a> personal finance dashboard is free to use. The company also offers investment-management services for a fee, but you don’t have to utilize the paid investment service to sign up for the free budgeting and money-tracking tools. And with a price you can’t beat, it’s certainly worth considering.</p><h3>3. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Quicken Simplifi</a></h3><h3 class=product-title>Simplifi</h3><p>Fees</p><p>$2.99 a month</p><p>Free Trial</p><p>No</p><p>Platform</p><p>Web, iOS, Android</p><p>Import from Quicken</p><p>No</p><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Quicken Simplifi</a> is a Quicken alternative made by the same company as Quicken. It’s a relatively low-cost option at $3.99 per month (billed annually). As the name suggests, it’s a simpler personal finance app focused on tracking your spending and financial account balances.</p><p>It’s not as robust as <a rel=alternate href=#>Quicken</a>, but <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Quicken Simplifi</a> includes everything most people need to understand their spending and financial position. It’s helpful and intuitive, so people new to budgeting or just wanting the basics may feel more comfortable with Simplifi than with more-complicated competitors.</p><h3>4. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Monarch</a></h3><h3 class=product-title>Monarch Money</h3><p>Fees</p><p>$14.99 a month or $99 a year</p><p>Free Trial</p><p>7 Days</p><p>Platform</p><p>Web, iOS, Android</p><p>Import from Quicken</p><p>Yes</p><p>Monarch is a comprehensive <a rel=alternate href=#>personal finance app</a> that handles budgeting, investments, and financial goal tracking, and includes helpful reports to understand your money.

It’s also a top <a rel=alternate href=#>replacement for Mint.com</a>, which closed up shop at the end of 2023.</p><p>You can use the app individually or invite a household member to share your account. It’s not the cheapest option at $14.99 per month or $99.99 per year ($8.33 per month), but it packs in a ton of valuable features, so the price tag may be worthwhile for households looking to wrangle all of their financial data in a single dashboard.</p><h3>5. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Rocket Money</a></h3><h3 class=product-title>Rocket Money Bill Reduction</h3><p>Free Trial</p><p>7 Days</p><p>Platform</p><p>Web, iOS, Android</p><p>Import from Quicken</p><p>No</p><p><a rel=alternate href=#>Rocket Money</a> is a personal finance app with free and premium editions.
