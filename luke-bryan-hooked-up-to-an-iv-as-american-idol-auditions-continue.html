He admitted that he wouldn’t take vitamins orally, so this was the solution Perry came up with.</p><p>Bryan actually kept the IV in his arm as singer Aniston Pate auditioned for the show. Aniston sang an original song she wrote about her mother called “Hummingbird.” The judges were impressed by the performance.</p><p>“About halfway through the first verse, I had to open my eyes and go, ‘Is that you, Dolly?'” Lionel Richie shared, comparing Aniston’s storytelling ability to Dolly Parton. The singer earned three “yes” votes to go to Hollywood.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’ JUDGES THINK THEY’VE FOUND THE WINNER AS AUDITIONS CONTINUE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-singer-performs-i-kissed-a-girl-for-katy-perry>Singer Performs ‘I Kissed a Girl’ for Katy Perry</h2><p>During Sunday’s episode, Madaí ChaKell auditioned for the show with a cover of “I Kissed a Girl” by judge Katy Perry, who seemed taken aback by the theatrical performance.

Scarlett finished the competition in second place. She auditioned for the American Idol judges in California, performing “Clown” by Emeli Sandé, which she said was her favorite song.</p><p>Scarlett earned a standing ovation from the judges for her performance, which brought Perry to tears. Perry acknowledged that Scarlett has a big personality, which can lead people to not take her seriously. But her performance “cut through all of the layers.”</p><p>All three judges voted “yes” to giving Scarlett a Golden Ticket to Hollywood. We’ll have to wait and see if she makes it through Hollywood Week later in the season.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_MileyCyrus_TishCyrus_Lester-CohenGetty-Images-for-The-Recording-Academy-220x147.jpeg alt="Rumored Cyrus Family Drama Includes Claim That Tish Stole Noah’s Boyfriend" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>luke bryan</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y66inmWSp8aiuoyhpqijlZl6tryMraZmmZ5itrd5wKxkmqWVp7akrc1moJ2nnGKutrDIraCopqNisLC606Klrp1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
