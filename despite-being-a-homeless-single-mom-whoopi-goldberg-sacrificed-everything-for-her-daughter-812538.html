She found herself at&nbsp;a&nbsp;low point, feeling lost and without a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;purpose. Goldberg described feeling trapped and hopeless, with limited opportunities due to&nbsp;her youth and lack of&nbsp;<a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a>.</p><p>She’d <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confess</a>: “I&nbsp;was convinced&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor. I&nbsp;just needed a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;time to&nbsp;convince the acting profession. So&nbsp;in&nbsp;between, I&nbsp;needed a&nbsp;job.” Therefore, determined to&nbsp;tackle new challenges, she moved to&nbsp;San Diego to&nbsp;cement herself into any kind of&nbsp;job. She ended up&nbsp;being a&nbsp;waitress, a&nbsp;bricklayer, and even a&nbsp;mortuary cosmetologist.</p><h2>Whoopi <a href=#>welcomed</a> her first and only daughter, but raised her entirely by&nbsp;herself.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/13e/703/4001db59879ab5b154e6e8c1ff.jpg><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News</p><p>Whoopi got married in&nbsp;1973 and became pregnant with her first child, Alexandrea Martin, who would also be&nbsp;her only child. Although she tried hard, life was challenging, and she had to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;food stamps as&nbsp;a&nbsp;welfare mother to&nbsp;support herself and her daughter. “I&nbsp;know what I’m talking about when I’m talking about the value of&nbsp;welfare because&nbsp;I was on&nbsp;it,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a45/fdd/56a08352d3b7c76d6e48d876e4.jpg><p>Goldberg was motivated by&nbsp;her mother’s example of&nbsp;single-handedly raising her and her brother. She became a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;unyielding support for her daughter and was dedicated to&nbsp;doing everything in&nbsp;her power to&nbsp;guarantee her well-being.</p><p>Also, her daughter got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>candid</a> about the difficulties they faced at&nbsp;that time, saying, “I&nbsp;know what it’s like with the food stamps. I&nbsp;remember that. I&nbsp;remember we&nbsp;slept in&nbsp;the bed together. I&nbsp;remember when we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;travel, we&nbsp;would drive across the country in&nbsp;broken-down bugs. We&nbsp;didn’t have the money to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the movies.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ddb/540/d516a755ffac2f79da00fdabac.jpg><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News</p><p>When asked why she considers her daughter to&nbsp;be&nbsp;her best friend, Goldberg <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>answered</a>, “Because she is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most trustworthy and loyal people I&nbsp;know. She is&nbsp;somebody who makes me&nbsp;laugh, and we&nbsp;can talk to&nbsp;each other at&nbsp;any time of&nbsp;the day or&nbsp;night.” Whoopi and Alexandrea have an&nbsp;exceptional bond that has been strengthened by&nbsp;their shared experiences of&nbsp;growing up&nbsp;together through challenging times.</p><p>They have been through thick and thin, holding hands every step of&nbsp;the way.
