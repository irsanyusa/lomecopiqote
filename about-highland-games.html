The Highland Games have been picked up across continents with the first Highland Games in the USA happening in New York in 1836. &nbsp;</p><p>The Caledonian Club of San Francisco held its first Games in 1866 and boasts the oldest continuously running Games in the USA with the St Andrews Society of Detroit hot on its tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Today, in addition to the Games across Scotland itself, there are more than 200 annual games and gatherings across the US and Canada, with games also in New Zealand and Australia.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Scotland Highland Games " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scotland.org/images/uploads/general/14282797811_161585a551_o.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>WHEN ARE THE HIGHLAND GAMES?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>In 2024, the Highland Games start in May, kicking off with the Gourock Highland Games.

Its origins are Royal too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The contests of strength – jumping, running, throwing and riding – were introduced by Malcolm Canmore in 1040 as a means of selecting the most able men for soldiers and couriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Bagpipes, Music and Highland dancing</h2><p>The Games, of course, are as much about music and dancing as they are about sports. Dancing, piping, fiddling, and playing the clarsach (Gaelic harp). There was a competitive element here too. The clan chieftains pitted their pipers against those of other clans and the prestige that came from success was considerable.</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scotland.org/images/uploads/general/visitscotland_26350487322.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The competitive element is a major attraction in its own right but when combined with the spectacle of Highland dancers and pipers and the colour and grandeur of the Scottish scenery which forms their backdrop, Highland Games become a must on any visitor's Scotland itinerary.</p><p><a href=#>Discover more about the&nbsp;</a><a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>bagpipes and Scotland's traditional music</a><a href=#>&nbsp;on visitscotland.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Discover more about&nbsp;traditional music festivals and gigs&nbsp;on visitscotland.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjp6tnqakqHyptcaho5qmlGK0ornErGaamp%2BqwW60yKCfpZmemXqorcyeqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
