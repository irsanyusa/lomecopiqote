And oh, do we want it, in 2021, when the pandemic has canceled its fair share of shows. Fortunately, we still have access to the thousands of worthy live albums that have been released over the decades in every genre … as a reminder of what we’re missing, yes, but as outstanding works of recorded art in their own right. From the Who to Beyonce to Bob Dylan to John Coltrane to Johnny Cash to KISS (and, yes, to the Stones!), here — in alphabetical order and citing when the recording(s) took place — are 50 live albums so good, you may find yourself wanting to quarantine with them even after concerts resume again.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Allman Brothers, 'At Fillmore East' (1971)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/allmanbrothersbandatfillmoreeast.jpg><p>Allmans Duane and Gregg, along with the Allman Brothers band, were still fresh to the studio recording game in 1971 and not selling all that well. Yet the guys made and maintained their reputation as gods of the South with their wildly expansive live shows and deeply soulful, jazzy jams. So the renowned Tom Dowd took to the boards to produce a run of March 1971 shows in New York City’s Fillmore East as if he was mixing one of the Allmans’ studio efforts, bringing to the project an extra-added warmth, precision and vulnerability that has made the collection a classic of the format.

This expansive set captures them at their absolute summit, at a memorable series of 1971 holiday shows at New York’s Academy of Music. Less grandiose than their “Last Waltz” farewell concert five years later, it finds the group rocking inimitably through their classics, accompanied by a horn section featuring Howard Johnson and Snooky Young (with arrangements by the great Allen Toussaint). An unexpected bonus came in 2000, when the last night’s encore, which featured four songs with Bob Dylan but was thought to be lost, was discovered on the master tapes and added to the reissue.

Rooted rhythmically with a drumline and brass band involving some two dozen musicians, Beyonce, whose credits on the project include live performance direction, executive production and music direction, proves that she’s one of the most innovative and visually arresting artists to exist in popular music — not that it was in any doubt — and that her songs, as sing-along-friendly as they may be, have a more pressing message to the universe. Still, there’s no denying Bey classics like “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)”&nbsp; and “Crazy In Love” and the three-song Destiny’s Child reunion alone is worth the price of admission. A masterpiece listen hitting all the nostalgia buttons as funk and R&B collides head-on with hip-hop and pop, and a celebration of Black excellence at its finest, this girl rules the world.

All of Bowie’s many ‘70s live albums have thrills to recommend them, but the ones that came out years or decades later generally beat the two that were contemporaneous at the time… not just this but “Bowie Live ’72,” “Cracked Actor,” “Welcome to the Blackout (Live London ‘79” and the just-released “I’m Only Dancing (The Soul Tour 1974).” So why elevate “Nassau”? In large part because of that 12-minute “Station to Station” opener, with guitarist Carlos Alomar taking us to Mars and beyond. There are more thrilling switch-ups just in that performance than most rockers’ entire careers.

From Fats Gonder’s rousing introduction to the nearly-11-minute “Lost Someone” and the show-stopping medley book-ended by an aching “Please Please Please,” this live set, barely half an hour long, made Brown into a household name in white America. (He would release two more live albums recorded at the venue, with the funky 1967 redux nearly equaling this one.)

Not if you’re Brandi Carlile, who — while then known nationally mostly just for the “The Story” — was already a superstar-equivalent in her hometown, and ready to revisit those three albums and a slew of covers besides with the help of a 35-piece orchestra. Any fear that she and her not so huge band might be overwhelmed by the augmentation is quickly supplanted on record by the reminder of her nearly threshold-free vocal range and power. But it would also fail to take into account the arranging mastery of Paul Buckmaster, who made his name on the early recordings of Carlile’s hero, Elton John, and who reaffirmed his mettle not just with her cover of Elton’s “Sixty Years On” but early original songs that made it clear she was well on her way to becoming the preeminent power balladeer of the 21st century.

This was not the first time Cash recorded behind bars, nor would it be the last: Some prefer 1969’s “At San Quentin,” Grammy-nominated for album of the year and a winner of best male country vocal performance (for “A Boy Named Sue”), but it was “Folsom” that set the standard.

Thus, it makes perfect sense that their global breakthrough came via this 1978 live album initially released only in Japan — and its scarcity actually made the buzz bigger. Unlike Cheap Trick’s debut album (which many felt was too heavy) or its follow up “In Color” (which many felt was too wimpy), “Budokan” presents the group in its best light: killer pop songs played by a world-class rock band, with Robin Zander’s versatile vocals and Rick Nielsen’s blazing guitar work front and center. (While the original 10-song album remains a classic, the reissue rolls out the entire 19-song set and a DVD of the complete performance.)

Not only was he still cementing his chemistry with newer collaborators like drummer Elvin Jones, pianist McCoy Tyner and bassist Jimmy Garrison – soon, those three would complete Coltrane’s greatest quartet — he was also already beginning to outgrow the style he had honed through years of collaboration with Miles Davis, and even his own more intense solo releases like recent breakthrough “Giant Steps.” This release, particularly the anarchic saxophone showcase “Chasin’ the Trane” that takes up the entire second side, was controversial in jazz circles at the time, with some critics considering it little more than aimless noise. But we all know better now. Coltrane had already taken dazzling technique as far as it would go, and for the rest of his life he would set his gaze toward more distant galaxies — consider this a test launch.

For that, one had to wait until 1985, when his wild set at Miami’s Harlem Square Club was finally released. At once emphatically spiritual and undeniably sexual, “Harlem Square” is every bit the equal of James Brown’s “Live at the Apollo” in its humid, reckless abandon, and there are moments here – especially the delirious rendition of “Bring It on Home to Me,” one of the most electrifying R&B performances ever committed to tape – where Cooke almost makes Otis Redding seem tame.

(This is the part where I get to humblebrag that I was there, and it was just as revelatory as you’ve heard.) Recorded a year later in Paris, “Alive 2007” captures a virtually identical show — easy to do with no acoustic instruments or live vocals to worry about — as the two robot rockers mash up their catalog in a variety of clever, cheeky, and infectious ways. The clear highlight is “One More Time/Aerodynamic,” on which DP toss two of their biggest tracks into a particle accelerator, creating a single, arena-annihilating monster.

In Chicago before Christmas ’65, Miles, saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock and bassist Ron Carter — at the urging of their drummer, Tony Williams — played every note by feel, the incendiary opposite of how the ensemble rendered these songs previously. Thankfully, this brilliant experiment, unreleased until 1995, was captured for posterity.

The concert, which actually took place in Manchester, was famous under any misidentification for being the one where an audience member shouted out “Judas!” in response to Dylan going electric, a schism that briefly tore apart a fan base that expected the bard to forever be the exemplar and protector of all things acoustic and protest-ant. On this tour (which is further documented, to a fault, in the 36-disc box “The 1966 Live Recordings”), Dylan did give the people what they wanted in the solo-acoustic first half. But hearing him take the stage with the Hawks (aka the future Band) for part two still feels like experiencing a revolution in which torrents of dazzling words met their match in brainy and brawny rock ‘n’ roll. You could, and should, watch Martin Scorsese’s “No Direction Home,” a documentary about Dylan’s and the world’s whole paradigm shift during this period. Or you could just listen to this album; without any filmmaking annotation, it still tells nearly the whole tale.

Schmit, the Eagles greatest hits (a collection of which was another top seller of the album and CD era) are well represented in this 1994 performance which followed more than a decade after Henley famously declared the band would no longer play together. Fortunately for fans of easy, breezy country rock, the 15-track collection stands the test of time, cycling through classics like “Tequila Sunrise,” “Hotel California,” “Take It Easy,” “Life in the Fast Lane” and “Desperado” with aplomb. Henley solo hit “New York Minute” never sounded better and Walsh’s “In the City” is also delightfully divine.

In the years prior to the show, Ellington’s big band music seemed to have grown hopelessly passé, and the band no longer even had a record deal. A short while after it, his face was on the cover of Time magazine, and the renewed public interest in Sir Duke’s catalog that followed would last for the rest of his life and beyond. Give this live recording one listen, and you’ll understand why. Despite a chaotic start, once the band gets rolling its momentum is almost frightening to behold; all of Ellington’s old classics sound brand new here, and Paul Gonsalves’ marathon sax solo on “Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue,” which sparked a genteel riot on the part of the audience, is simply one of the landmark instrumental performances of the 20th century.

It represented the group’s first official release in a decade, bringing back together Nicks and Buckingham after a several year absence. And it would go on to be the last recording to feature Christine McVie, who left the group the following year, though she would return to further touring. Indeed, over the band’s 50-year career, they’ve fine-tuned their hit-heavy set and “The Dance,” recorded as a TV special, is as good an example of that as any. From the march of “The Chain,” which kicks off this 17-track collection and symbolizes the band members reconnecting, to Nicks’ powerhouse vocals on “Silver Springs” to Buckingham’s guitar skills on “My Little Demon” and McVie’s understated “Say You Love Me” and “You Make Loving Fun,” there’s a lot to love on this 1997 performance.

Peter Frampton was a rather obscure U.K. rocker at the time of this album’s release, but within weeks the lead single, “Show Me the Way,” combined with Frampton’s looks and hooks had vaulted him to superstardom: The set charted for almost 100 weeks and sold 11 million copies worldwide.

While we definitely could live without her Bread cover, Aretha Franklin shines with soulful takes on songs like Stephen Stills’ “Love the One You’re With,” a gospel “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” and the Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby” — and brings the house down when Ray Charles joins her for “Spirit in the Dark.”(JA)</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Grateful Dead, 'Europe '72'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grateful_dead_-_europe_72.jpg><p>Ask a hundred Deadheads to name the band’s best live recording, and you’ll probably get 101 different answers. But ask anyone to name the band’s most emblematic live recording, and this triple-album will surely be the standard-bearer. There was evidently something truly special about the Dead’s ’72 tour (see also: the looser, sweatier Oregon set released as “Sunshine Daydream”), and for those of us who were too young to see Jerry & Co. in their prime, this is the album that introduced us to some of the band’s signature onstage magic tricks: the ecstatic extended coda to “Sugar Magnolia,” the alchemical way “China Cat Sunflower” eases into “I Know You Rider,” the band’s ability to turn old country standards like “You Win Again” into molasses-thick jams. You could probably spend a lifetime exploring every nook and cranny of the Dead’s live archives, but this is the gateway drug that sets you on the path.

But if you really want to understand why she’s properly regarded as one of greatest musical minds of the 20th century, it’s her later, headier, more jazz-inspired albums that really stake the claim, and this 1979 live run-through of some of those highlights is an excellent place to start. Backed by a who’s-who of fusion greats, from Pat Metheny and Michael Brecker to tragic bass guitar god Jaco Pastorius — whose lyrical fretless basslines are prominent enough that he’s as much Mitchell’s co-star as her sideman – Mitchell proves herself just as sharp a bandleader as a songwriter. Her earlier material is largely absent here, but when she does dip into her folk catalog — such as the radically reworked “Woodstock” that closes the show — it’s less a concession to her fans than a challenge, and a warning that she’s not looking to get herself back to the garden anytime soon.

In Buck’s case, there was no trying to meet any solemnity of the moment. “Carnegie Hall Concert” is a beginning-to-end blast, taking off airs and taking the Manhattan tiger by the tail. What’s most memorable about the show has less to do with the “hillbillies meet the highbrows” incongruity that was clearly intended to grab LP buyers’ fancy than it does to do with how great a band album this is.

(Or in having Shepard Fairey’s cover illustration of Petty not writ large?) The 48 tracks are not arranged chronologically, yet somehow they add up to the feeling of one long show — okay, at four hours, an inhumanly long one? For anyone who ever wanted to hear a Petty set list with deeper tracks amid the “I Won’t Back Downs” and “Refugees,” this fan-focused compendium hit the spot, with covers of the Grateful Dead, early Fleetwood Mac, James Brown, Willie Dixon, Van Morrison and a Bond theme in among “Angel Dream (No. 2)” and “Spike.” Yet you’d be co-opting a phrase from Petty and singing “too much is enough” if the Heartbreakers weren’t the most effortlessly fluid American band rock ‘n’ roll has ever seen, always leaving ‘em wanting more.

Sinatra and Basie were old hands at collaborating at this point, having worked together on a couple of studio albums at this point, and however much we might love the elegance of the singer’s work with Nelson Riddle, hearing a sound that truly jumps, in a way that could make grown men tingle like Tommy Dorsey-era bobbysoxers, is just as much the apotheosis of Frankdom.

Led by one of the decade’s most slyly charismatic frontmen in bassist-vocalist Phil Lynott, Lizzy’s performance here is both impeccably rehearsed and comfortably loose, and the setlist shows just how profound an influence the band was on the next ten years of rock music, from its proto-Iron Maiden thrashers (“Emerald,” “Massacre”) to soft rock-adjacent R&B (“Dancing in the Moonlight”) to lighters-in-the-air power ballads from which Bon Jovi would so blatantly crib (“Cowboy Song”). And yes, “The Boys Are Back in Town” is on here too, and it blows the studio version out of the water.

At the time, few could have guessed this White Stripes live release would be a swan song for Jack White and Meg White as musical partners, following on the heels of what turned out to be their final studio album, “Icky Thump.” Many other live recordings surfaced before and since, of course, with the Third Man label and its Vault being about nothing if not the sense that vaults are bottomless treasures. But this 16-track set remains the definitive live document, regardless of whether you consider it a soundtrack album to the Canuck-philiac documentary film of the same name or its own thing. It encompasses blues, country and Bacharach/David covers but mostly it gives us a kind of rock ‘n’ roll we hadn’t quite heard before the duo’s debut just shy of a decade earlier: the warm, mysterious, ingratiating, earsplitting sound of the world’s tiniest army.

This album explains exactly why Roger Daltrey’s soaring vocals, Keith Moon’s avalanche drumming, John Entwistle’s virtuoso bass playing and Pete Townshend’s stellar songs and blistering guitar work made for a uniquely explosive combination, and the group tears through its early singles, several old-school rock covers and songs from “Tommy.” “Live at Leeds” has been reissued, remixed and added to multiple times — you can now get not just the entire original Leeds set but an almost identical one from the following night — but the original six-song version has long been considered by many to be the best live rock album of all time.

While it is perhaps even more famous for its between-song “Don’t take the brown acid” banter from Chip Monck, Wavy Gravy and the like, it also features stellar performances from Sly & the Family Stone, Jimi Hendrix (his iconic “Star Spangled Banner”), Joe Cocker (his soulful reimagining of the Beatles’ “With a Little Help From My Friends”), Santana, Ten Years After, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and even Sha Na Na. And for anyone who really wants to go back, there’s Andy Zax and Steve Woolard’s completist 38-disc, $800 box set, “Back to the Garden,” which captures every single note of music from the festival, and lots more besides.
