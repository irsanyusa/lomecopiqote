He joined season 14 of Britain’s Got Talent and smoothly reached the Finale through the unique execution of his magic tricks. This year, he will take the AGT All-Stars.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jasper Cherry Had an Impressive Run on Britain’s Got Talent Series 14</h2><p>Jasper Cherry proved that he’s no typical magician on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BGT</a>. His audition consisted of placing a handkerchief in his hand and turning it into an egg. In the middle of his act, he said that the magic would be spoiled if the hole in the egg will be seen, where the handkerchief was inserted.</p><p>He then remarked that such would be the case “unless you are a real magician,” subsequently pulling a sticker off the egg where the hole was supposedly drilled. To further prove his point, he cracked the egg into a glass. This unusual presentation of magic has captivated both the judges and the audience, thus sending him to the next round.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/RQfQWy48P-4</p></figure><p>During his Semifinal performance, he convinced everyone that he could warp reality by travelling back in time. This one totally stumped the judges, and we can’t even begin to explain how he did it. With this incredible act comes no surprise that he would win UK and advance to the Finale, and he did.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In the Finale, Jasper’s performance has become even more high-level than before. He introduced a drinks carton whose function was to “create any drink in the world instantly.” Using this single carton, he managed to pour orange juice, milk, cherry-cola, strawberry milkshake, Rosé Wine, and a drink of judge Ashley Banjo’s choice —beer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-he-been-up-to-now>What Has He Been Up To Now?</h2><p>Despite his failsafe performance in the Finals, musical comedian Jon Courtenay was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>crowned winner</a>. Yet, Jasper’s journey doesn’t stop with Britain’s Got Talent.</p><p>&nbsp;“I want to be a famous magician and travel around the world performing magic,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “Working with other magicians I have looked up to like Dynamo and Shin Lim would be a dream come true for sure.”</p><p>Since he joined the said competition, Jasper received support from his hometown. His classmates in Ribblesdale High School even volunteered to be his assistant when he practices his tricks. Be that as it may, his mother has always noted that he must still focus on his schoolwork.</p><p>After BGT, Jasper has been booked to perform magic all around England. He also records some of his rehearsals and uploads it on TikTok and Instagram. Last October, he announced that he’s been invited to join America’s Got Talent’s spin-off series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT All-Stars</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_WorldTaekowando_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Three-Time ‘Got Talent’ Golden Buzzer Recipient World Taekwondo Demonstration Team" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuZpyfmsButMRmm6hlmal6o7PTZqqtmZ6ZvLbAjKOYrKiVp3qktMSrqbJlpKR6rq3KnmSgp6RiwaK4xKerZqqVqcKzuoyopWaZl6l6orjLZqqtmaKofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
