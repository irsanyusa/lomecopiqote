Their self-titled collection has a sound built on the foundation of their tight, melodic harmonies with a kind of down-home woodsy vibe representative of their musically-rich Oregonian upbringing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The tracks range from deeply emotional soft-pop to harder hitting pop-rock with elements of pop-country in their more cheerful tracks,&nbsp;Hold On being my personal favorite. The trio got their start on season 13 of America’s Got Talent, auditioning with an original song, Heaven’s Not Too Far, written from the perspective of their mother in her final months before passing away from cancer. The performance was an obvious (if not tearful) hit with both the audience and the judges, and the Humlie siblings made it through to the semifinals before being eliminated during the Judges’ Choice.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p class=p1>Despite not making it through to the final, We Three told&nbsp;Parade of their time on the show, “This is really a dream come true and we hope fans enjoy all the songs that mean so much to us as well. We are so grateful for the opportunity that being on America’s Got Talent gave us as it has led us to this moment.”&nbsp;Heaven’s Not Too Far was released as the band’s first single is one of four songs—including Lifeline, So They Say, and Makeup—that made their debut on AGT before finding a home on the album. So much of the focus around talent competitions is put onto figuring out who will ultimately win, and rightly so, but We Three is a good example of the reality that the journey doesn’t end when the confetti falls, it’s just the beginning.</p><p><a href=#>We Three</a> is available now.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Masked-Singer-Jenny-Donnie.jpg alt="VIDEO: Jenny McCarthy Thought Her Husband Might Be on ‘The Masked Singer’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>we three</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlsBus86tZK2ZnJq7tXnVnqueqpGjwG7DxGaroaqVmnqzscuemKydXZmyo8HTZpilmqWifA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
