But as&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, nothing could be&nbsp;further from the truth! We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have analyzed what publications around the world say about billionaires, and discovered several types of&nbsp;purchases which&nbsp;— unlike me&nbsp;and you&nbsp;— the wealthy and successful prefer to&nbsp;avoid!</p><p><h2>Impulse purchases</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/48e/59e/82c8d8535f9e5172e6bbcad886.jpg><p>Here’s something that happens to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;us: we&nbsp;see a&nbsp;pretty but useless thing being offered at&nbsp;a&nbsp;discount, we&nbsp;buy&nbsp;it, and then we&nbsp;come home and regret our decision. All too often, we&nbsp;spend money on&nbsp;impulse purchases which is&nbsp;what distinguishes&nbsp;us from rich people, to&nbsp;whom buying an&nbsp;extra pair of&nbsp;jeans holds little attraction. As&nbsp;billionaire <a href=#>Warren Buffett </a>once said, ’If you buy things you don’t need, soon you will have to&nbsp;sell things you need." An&nbsp;effective way to&nbsp;<a href=#>avoid</a> unnecessary spending is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;shopping list before going to&nbsp;the store.</p><p><h2>Expensive real estate</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c3a/852/21f2065b54ada3e663d0489592.jpg><p>Buying luxury houses at&nbsp;inflated prices is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dubious investment. That is&nbsp;why <a href=#>rich people </a>prefer to&nbsp;buy promising real estate while it’s still <a href=#>cheap</a> to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;profit later on&nbsp;when its price skyrockets.</p><p><h2>Clothing and footwear from high-end brands</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cea/6d9/6554435493b5a95ccd2c0529bd.jpg><p>Rich people can afford luxurious and expensive clothes from the newest and trendiest designer collections. However, if&nbsp;their life doesn’t involve frequent social events, they prefer to&nbsp;steer clear of&nbsp;such purchases. Remember how Steve Jobs used to&nbsp;dress? Similarly, Bill Gates’ watch costs $10; and Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is&nbsp;perfectly okay with appearing in&nbsp;public wearing <a href=#>bargain basement t-shirts</a>. Even the wife of&nbsp;the heir to&nbsp;the British throne often goes out sporting mass market outfits!</p><p><h2>Latest versions of&nbsp;popular gadgets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a0/857/add78f5bbba53699d3f8334f8e.jpg><p>A&nbsp;wealthy person will not rush out to&nbsp;buy the latest model of&nbsp;a&nbsp;trendy smartphone or&nbsp;watch even if&nbsp;his or&nbsp;her gadget is&nbsp;out of&nbsp;fashion, time-worn, or&nbsp;obsolete. Millionaires use different reasoning when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;making purchases: they ask themselves whether the expenditure will be&nbsp;worthwhile at&nbsp;this particular moment. As&nbsp;for electronic gadgets, they become outdated and <a href=#>depreciate</a> in&nbsp;value way too quickly!</p><p><h2>Loans, fees, and penalties for late payments</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d54/1ab/0469e4588f96b2f6ad88ff9e04.jpg><p>Rich people don’t take out loans and never lose money on&nbsp;fines, penalties, and commissions for one simple reason: they always pay everything on&nbsp;time, avoiding delays. As&nbsp;billionaire investor, <a href=#>Mark Cuban</a> said, ’If you use a&nbsp;credit card, you don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rich."</p><p><h2>Buying your kids lots of&nbsp;fancy toys</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aac/2ec/8b34c75a47a512fc622ff4fc2a.jpg><p>People with average incomes often pamper their kids, buy stuff on&nbsp;their little ones’ slightest whims, filling their rooms with trendy new toys. Now, if&nbsp;millionaires behaved in&nbsp;the same fashion, their children would literally be&nbsp;drowning in&nbsp;toys and gadgets! However, well-to-do people prefer <a href=#>reasonable</a> expenses and don’t buy their offspring a&nbsp;new doll or&nbsp;playset just because it’s being advertised on&nbsp;TV.</p><p><h2>Junk food</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ec/7e8/0489185ee68addeea5e280c6de.jpg><p>The most important difference between a&nbsp;millionaire’s daily menu and that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person with a&nbsp;modest income is&nbsp;not in&nbsp;the cost of&nbsp;products. Rich people are literally <a href=#>obsessed</a> with <a href=# title="healthy eating" data-link=tag>healthy eating</a>. They might be&nbsp;consuming the same types of&nbsp;cereals and vegetables as&nbsp;we, mere mortals&nbsp;do, but you wouldn’t catch a&nbsp;billionaire wolfing down kebabs, hamburgers, French fries, or&nbsp;mayonnaise-rich salads from the “ready-to-eat” supermarket section.</p><p><h2>Representation expenses</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fd/f1f/804c535b1aa48498e76acb3681.jpg><p>Basically, this encompasses the costs of&nbsp;making oneself seem rich and successful. Or&nbsp;to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;even simpler&nbsp;— of&nbsp;throwing dust in&nbsp;other people’s eyes. We’re talking about luxury banquets, business class flights, and new cars. People who want to&nbsp;appear richer than they really are, spend huge sums to&nbsp;this effect. On&nbsp;the other hand, the truly successful ones often lead very modest lives. For instance, <a href=#>Ingvar Kamprad</a>, the founder of&nbsp;IKEA, always flew economy class and drove an&nbsp;old Volvo. As&nbsp;for the Queen of&nbsp;England, Elizabeth II&nbsp;— she <a href=#>saves electricity</a> at&nbsp;her Buckingham Palace residence.</p><p><h2>Additional education for their children</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c70/661/a5de455363b9ca0820929f50ed.jpg><p>People with an&nbsp;average income often hire various <a href=#>home tutors</a> for their kids. Some do&nbsp;it&nbsp;hoping to&nbsp;reveal the child’s hidden talents, which will serve as&nbsp;his or&nbsp;her ticket to&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy, prosperous life. Others think that the tutors will help the child achieve better grades at&nbsp;school. As&nbsp;for rich people&nbsp;— they know from personal experience that excessive tutoring has little to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with achieving financial success. So&nbsp;they allow their little ones more free time to&nbsp;enjoy childhood.</p><p><h2>Psychics, mystics, and fortune-tellers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e35/336/882dcb54f18663af66fe59e145.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>research</a>, for the most part, fortune-tellers’ clientele is&nbsp;made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;people with low analytical skills. At&nbsp;the same time, logical thinking is&nbsp;probably the key quality for achieving wealth and success. Besides, high-achievers tend to&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;themselves&nbsp;— they simply don’t need any otherworldly assistance!</p><p><h2>Personal development coaching</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4a/e10/654ce75b4d9b40f2b2e11b9762.jpg><p>Low-earners with lousy careers and private lives are the main targets of&nbsp;unscrupulous life and business coaches. Many words have been said about the uselessness of&nbsp;such training sessions, especially in&nbsp;connection with <a href=#>Tony Robbins</a>. His seminars earn him millions thanks to&nbsp;high ticket prices and the fact that there’s still no&nbsp;shortage of&nbsp;those who want to&nbsp;pump up&nbsp;their social skills. Before spending your money on&nbsp;various motivational courses, take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the biographies of&nbsp;famous billionaires: it&nbsp;is&nbsp;unlikely you will find a&nbsp;single story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person getting rich by&nbsp;listening to&nbsp;overhyped lifestyle gurus.</p><p><h2>Trendy interior design</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c7/fd0/cc17455d7cbef89e93610ed0bb.jpg><p>New types of&nbsp;furniture and interior decor appear in&nbsp;shops on&nbsp;a&nbsp;monthly basis. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, middle class people spend lots of&nbsp;money, trying to&nbsp;follow the latest trends in&nbsp;house decor. Unfortunately, such design solutions tend to&nbsp;become outdated in&nbsp;just a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years’ time. All of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, no&nbsp;one uses floral wallpaper anymore, and bright geometric patterns are all the rage. Time to&nbsp;redecorate everything! But before you do&nbsp;that, make sure to&nbsp;study a&nbsp;few photos of&nbsp;rich people’s home interior. Quite often, when looking at&nbsp;successful individuals’ homes, you can’t guess how old the owners are. Painted walls, whitewashed ceilings, and wooden or&nbsp;tiled floors: the rich adhere to&nbsp;perennial, century-tested options!</p><p>Changing one’s spending habits is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;easy task: you’ll have to&nbsp;revise your lifestyle and make adjustments to&nbsp;your worldview along the way! Do&nbsp;you think you’re up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the challenge? Are there any expenses you feel you can ditch with ease? And what money-draining aspects of&nbsp;your life would you never say goodbye&nbsp;to (not even for the sake of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;brighter future)?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zedOhoKefo2K%2Fqq%2FHZqeep6Chsm6%2FxKWbqKVdl8K6edahoKWdXam1pnnPqKarZZGnsm6w0aiup6GenHqquoydnJusXam8brPErWStoJWienh9j3JoaWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
