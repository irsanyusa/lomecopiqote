This happened, for example, with Hayden Panettiere. In&nbsp;2014, the actress expressed a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>desire</a> to&nbsp;wear one of&nbsp;Tom Ford’s creations during the Golden Globe Awards. But the brand representatives refused, saying that the designer had a&nbsp;rule of&nbsp;dressing only one celebrity per event, and it&nbsp;was Naomi Watts for that particular event.</p><p>However, Hayden was adamant in&nbsp;her desire to&nbsp;wear the dress she liked, and simply bought&nbsp;it. At&nbsp;the ceremony, the actress looked fantastic wearing the monochrome dress complete with side split and spaghetti strap halter-neck. And Tom Ford sent her flowers and a&nbsp;note the following day, saying that she had looked beautiful.</p><p><h2>Cardi B’s gown needed its own 10-person entourage</h2></p><p>It’s no&nbsp;secret that celebrities are often accompanied by&nbsp;1-2 assistants during red carpet events. But <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cardi B</a>&nbsp;set a&nbsp;record. To&nbsp;walk the red carpet in&nbsp;her red gown with a&nbsp;huge trail at&nbsp;the Met Gala 2019, she needed an&nbsp;entourage of&nbsp;10&nbsp;people who patiently wrapped and unwrapped this trail. Of&nbsp;course, the gown became the reason for many Internet <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>memes</a>.</p><p><h2>Elle Fanning fainted because her dress was too tight.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eeb/add/69650e5e2f877ab29479fffa1c.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most beautiful guests at&nbsp;The Chopard Trophy event in&nbsp;Cannes, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Elle Fanning</a>, said later that she had fainted because her 1950s Prada prom dress was too tight.</p><p><h2>Blake Lively hired a&nbsp;bus to&nbsp;transport her dress.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d9/a78/aac9f753a585fc7be1a96cb25d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2018, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Blake Lively</a> stunned everyone when she made her Met Gala appearance wearing an&nbsp;incredible custom-made dress covered in&nbsp;tiny rhinestones, designed by&nbsp;Versace. The dress was so&nbsp;elaborate that it&nbsp;took the dress’ designers 600 hours to&nbsp;embroider the dress alone. And to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the event, the actress had to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;party bus.</p><p><h2>Selena Gomez couldn’t eat because of&nbsp;the cut of&nbsp;her dress.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/353/449/415e0855e392a655a454465cb6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2020, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Selena Gomez</a> attended the Hollywood Beauty Awards wearing a&nbsp;blush pink dress by&nbsp;Patou. The dress looked beautiful and quite simple when she was posing to&nbsp;the photographers, but when she sat at&nbsp;the table, it&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;not that comfortable as&nbsp;everyone might think. Her off-the-shoulder sleeves were so&nbsp;far down on&nbsp;her arms that she couldn’t lift them even to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;sip of&nbsp;water.</p><p><h2>Keira Knightley’s dress split in&nbsp;half before hitting a&nbsp;red carpet.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab7/e4a/a41f435218999831c78401e316.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Keira Knightly</a> likes to&nbsp;play it&nbsp;safe and usually prepares a&nbsp;few dresses for an&nbsp;event. Once this habit of&nbsp;hers helped her out in&nbsp;a&nbsp;delicate situation. In&nbsp;2005, right before Keira stepped on&nbsp;the red carpet, her dress split from the bottom to&nbsp;the top. But the actress changed her dress quickly, and posed in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;photographers as&nbsp;if&nbsp;nothing happened.</p><p><h2>Kylie Jenner couldn’t zip her dress, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hand-sewn.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3a/6c0/b1e533512f95cb019414e2a28a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2021, <a href=# title="Kylie Jenner" data-link=tag>Kylie Jenner</a> stunned in&nbsp;a&nbsp;1987 <a href=# title=vintage data-link=tag>vintage</a> Jean Paul Gaultier green dress at&nbsp;the 72nd Annual Parsons Benefit. Her dress fit like a&nbsp;glove. But it&nbsp;turned out that Jenner’s assistant had to&nbsp;sew the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a> right on&nbsp;her body.</p><p><h2>Bella Hadid was unable to&nbsp;take off her catsuit and go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the toilet.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec0/1a7/d9f12f5e4290d8b8aac0887345.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2017, <a href=# title="Bella Hadid" data-link=tag>Bella Hadid</a> attended the Met Gala wearing a&nbsp;crystallized full bodysuit by&nbsp;Alexander Wang, which was incredible as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was uncomfortable. The catsuit was so&nbsp;tight that Bella couldn’t visit a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bathroom</a> throughout the entire evening.</p><p><h2>Lindsay Lohan was so&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;ruin her dress that she sat most of&nbsp;the night.</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Lindsay Lohan" data-link=tag>Lindsay Lohan</a> chose a&nbsp;cream satin dress by&nbsp;Versace with a&nbsp;flowing trail for her first Vanity Fair Oscar party in&nbsp;2006. 16&nbsp;years later, the actress revealed that that night was quite painful to&nbsp;her. Lindsay’s dress was so&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>delicate</a> that they had to&nbsp;stitch the back of&nbsp;the dress on&nbsp;to&nbsp;her. And she was so&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;ruin it&nbsp;that she tried not to&nbsp;move for the entire night.</p><p><h2>Anne Hathaway sneezed, and her dress split on&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;the event.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8b/0bc/e23e4654cc9422eff8afabe594.jpg><p>She looks identical to someone I know help</p><p>In&nbsp;2014, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Anne Hathaway</a> stunned in&nbsp;a&nbsp;custom-made tight dress by&nbsp;Calvin Klein at&nbsp;the Met Gala. A&nbsp;few years later, the actress revealed that when she was a&nbsp;block away from her destination, she sneezed and her dress split. To&nbsp;fix her outfit, Anne had to&nbsp;stop at&nbsp;a&nbsp;nearby hotel and find a&nbsp;seamstress. But everything ended well, and the actress managed to&nbsp;arrive at&nbsp;the event on&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2>Kim Kardashian had to&nbsp;lose 16&nbsp;pounds to&nbsp;fit in&nbsp;the dress.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/854/638/ffa186559a9254e2386c2079ca.jpg><p>Kim Kardashian chose Marilyn Monroe’s iconic dress to&nbsp;wear at&nbsp;the Met Gala 2022. This sparkling translucent dress embellished with crystals was worn by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a> on&nbsp;John F. Kennedy’s birthday. This dress was acquired by&nbsp;Ripley’s Believe It&nbsp;Or&nbsp;Not Museum for a&nbsp;few million dollars, and it&nbsp;was almost impossible to&nbsp;get&nbsp;it, but Kim managed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it.</p><p>The dress was sent to&nbsp;the celebrity on&nbsp;a&nbsp;private plane with security guards. And even though the replica that had been delivered to&nbsp;Kim a&nbsp;few days earlier fitted her, the original dress turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too small. The only way out was to&nbsp;lose some weight before the event, and Kardashian had to&nbsp;lose 16&nbsp;pounds in&nbsp;3&nbsp;weeks. All of&nbsp;this was done so&nbsp;that she had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;walk the red carpet and pose before cameras in&nbsp;the dress of&nbsp;her dreams, just for a&nbsp;few minutes. After that, the celebrity had to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;replica dress, while the original dress was returned to&nbsp;the museum.</p><p>Did something similar ever happen to&nbsp;you?
