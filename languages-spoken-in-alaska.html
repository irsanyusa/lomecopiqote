That’s a great question—without one simple response. If you were expecting the answer to be “Alaskan,” you’re in for a surprise! In fact, among the population of 736,990 in the US state of Alaska, there are many languages spoken—close to two dozen. 
In this post, we’ll cover everything you’ve been wondering about the languages spoken in Alaska, including how many languages there are, which are the most common and how many people speak them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

By far, English is the language that’s mostly spoken in Alaska, with about 84% of the population saying English is their primary language.&nbsp;</p><p>So, how many people speak each language other than English? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Here’s a breakdown</a> of the most commonly spoken languages:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Spanish:</strong> Almost 26,000 people</li><li><strong>Other Indo-European languages:</strong> Around 15,000 people</li><li><strong>Asian and Pacific Island languages:</strong> About 40,000 people</li><li><strong>Native Alaskan languages:</strong> The most common is Central Alaskan Yup’ik with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">around 10,000 speakers</a>; Siberian Yupik comes in second with about 1,050 speakers</li></ul><p>As you can see, Alaska’s native languages aren’t spoken by many people. Some dialects, like the Athabascan language Holikachuk, have no more than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">twelve speakers</a>. In answer to this, there’s been an ongoing focus on the creation of resources, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">programs</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">guidelines</a> to help protect and strengthen these endangered heritage languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Do-Alaskans-have-accents>Do Alaskans have accents?</h2><p>This question isn’t as straightforward to answer as you might think. With the Alaskan population speaking the mix of languages we described above, there’s no such thing as one “Alaskan” accent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Having said that, there are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a few factors that may contribute</a> to what you could identify as a distinctly Alaskan way of speaking. First of all, many Alaskan residents originally came from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pacific Northwest</a> (the northwestern part of the US and the southwestern part of Canada). As a result, you might find that some Alaskan speech borrows from the sounds in that region. Some may even have speech patterns that sound almost stereotypically Canadian.&nbsp;</p><p>Many residents of Alaska also come from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Midwestern United States</a>, so that regional accent probably influences Alaskan speech as well. Of course, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native languages</a> are also an influence, but mostly only in remote areas.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-are-some-common-Alaskan-native-phrases>What are some common Alaskan native phrases?</h2><p>Ready to learn some Alaskan vocabulary?
