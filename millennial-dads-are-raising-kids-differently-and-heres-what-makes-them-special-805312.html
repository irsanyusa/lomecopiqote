It looks like the fathers of Gen Y have their own views on family and parenting. They seem to be generally more involved in spending time with their children, and taking paternity leave to share the child-rearing duties with their partners has become their new norm.
We at Bright Side took a closer look at the portrait of a modern dad, and here’s what we found out.
They are more engaged in raising children than dads of previous generations."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They tend to&nbsp;see parenting as&nbsp;an&nbsp;integral part of&nbsp;their life and identity. Modern dads are not only more enthusiastic about bringing up&nbsp;kids, but they also tend to&nbsp;help their partners more with household chores.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c33/568/c023ee5ff4ba4b74402d253dbd.jpg><p><h2>Many millennial dads are even taking paternity leave.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/866/213/944dff51728c080ed90de47eae.jpg><p>While maternity leave is&nbsp;something we’ve all gotten used&nbsp;to, for many people <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paternity</a> leave is&nbsp;still something new. The dads from Gen Y&nbsp;<strong>don’t hesitate to&nbsp;ask their bosses for parental leave</strong> to&nbsp;help their partners with kids at&nbsp;home. So, more and more companies are taking steps to&nbsp;provide equal parental opportunities for moms and dads.</p><p>Some of&nbsp;them choose to&nbsp;stay with newborns while the babies’ moms are working. A&nbsp;shared parental leave is&nbsp;a&nbsp;compromise that allows both moms and dads to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;home with kids.</p><p><h2>They adjust their careers to&nbsp;spend more time with their kids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/94d/e6d/bb2c095be4b99ba0eea023aab6.jpg><p>Not all millennial dads are ready to&nbsp;completely give up&nbsp;their careers and switch to&nbsp;raising kids at&nbsp;home. Many of&nbsp;them still remain the breadwinners, but even in&nbsp;this case, they find <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ways</a> to&nbsp;spend more time with their sons and daughters. They request flexible schedules at&nbsp;work or&nbsp;<strong>start their own businesses</strong> that can be&nbsp;run from home and that allow them to&nbsp;successfully combine work with parenting.</p><p>Other career <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>strategies</a> chosen by&nbsp;millennial dads may include working from home 1&nbsp;day a&nbsp;week or&nbsp;leaving a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours earlier. Of&nbsp;course, not all companies are ready to&nbsp;provide flexible work schedules for young dads, but the situation is&nbsp;slowly changing, as&nbsp;more and more fathers <strong>strive to&nbsp;balance family and work</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd5/66d/8db9135a1281245f8406130bb8.jpg><p><h2>They are super safe and responsible.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4d/9c1/08fce35c4cb6ce7293d9feb465.jpg><p>Both moms and dads of&nbsp;the millennial generation seem to&nbsp;often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>address</a> the internet when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;safety tips. While the typical safety equipment of&nbsp;parents from previous generations would have been safety belts and bike helmets, today’s parents have an&nbsp;<strong>avalanche of&nbsp;websites and mobile apps</strong> at&nbsp;their disposal. The internet is&nbsp;the source where parents of&nbsp;today learn all the information on&nbsp;child upbringing, including health, daily routines, eating habits, games, and education.</p><p>The lives of&nbsp;millennials’ kids are <strong>more scheduled than ever before</strong>. The pace and rhythm of&nbsp;modern life urge parents to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>plan</a> not only their working hours but their free time and their whole family life. The necessity to&nbsp;plan everything created a&nbsp;phenomenon called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>“play date”</a> which&nbsp;is, in&nbsp;fact, a&nbsp;planned gathering for kids to&nbsp;play. While the children of&nbsp;several couples are playing together, their parents can discuss their own issues, make friends, and build businesses.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you agree that each generation has its own parenting approach? Do&nbsp;you see the features we’ve just discussed in&nbsp;millennial dads?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqquMuepaehkaF6pa3DrGSaqpViv6K10qKloGWbnrG0ecOinZ%2Bdopq7tbjYZpinnF2dsrOx0mauoZmkYrqit8SsZK2glaJ6tLzEnKCapF1tfXZ%2FkGtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
