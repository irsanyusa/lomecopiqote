And they’re taking it to the next level with a DC Superheroes Night!

She says that growing up, she was “just your average professional figure skater with Olympic dreams.” Squirrel wanted to be a top psychologist. Her superpower is empathy, she claims while we see a smiley face button on one of the men in black. But instead, she found herself in “the psycho city of Hollywood.” A giant ape crashes into her session. Squirrel then signs an autograph for him and walks along a wall filled with barcodes.</p><p>What happens next “could have happened to billions of bombshells,” she mentions. We see a plate of meatballs while she says, “I modeled for a major agency, did some teen acne commercials, landed some international sitcom parts, and made out with Tom Cruise!” Squirrel mentions that she still loves playing superheroes and also the girls next door who happen to be funny. Men in black walk by with a white castle cutout.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MEDUSA? CLUES DECODED + PREDICTION!</a></strong></p><p>Once her performance ended, we got a special guest appearance from DC comic book artist Jim Lee. He showed off a drawing of Batman with “Hero Time” written in the cityscape. Squirrel explained that “just like that piece of art, I put time into my work. But it’s all worth it when I get to watch the final product!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Squirrel</h2><p>Jenny kicked off the predictions, guessing this could be Naomi Watts or Katie Holmes. Ken threw out Michelle Moynahan, Renee Zellweger, and Margot Robbie as potential options. Robin went down the superhero road, guessing Uma Thurman.</p><p>Online, fans agree this could be Katie Holmes, but also predicted it could be Anne Hathaway, Malin Akerman, Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johannson, or Kaley Cuoco. One thing is for sure: her identity is very much up in the air!</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 9 EXCLUSIVE PREMIERE PHOTOS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Squirrel on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Looking through all the (very specific) clues, the choice for the Squirrel was obvious! And it is none other than…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Malin Akerman!</h2><p>Here’s how all the clues line up.</p><p>Squirrel said she was a professional figure skater growing up and Malin has posted about her figure skating on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, as well as mentioning it in <a href=#>interviews</a>. She also mentioned wanting to be a psychologist and Malin went to school for child psychology. Squirrel also gave a list of her past accomplishments, which perfectly align to Malin’s life. The first was modeling for a major agency, Ford Models. We saw meatballs which are a nod to her being Swedish. Then she mentioned doing teen acne commercials and Malin worked with Noxzema. She talked about international sitcoms, which she’s starred in plenty of, then talked about how she’s made out with Tom Cruise, which she did starring alongside him on Rock of Ages.</p><p>There were plenty of clues pointing to her superhero role in Watchmen, including the smiley pin, the “hero time” drawing, and Squirrel saying she likes playing superheroes. We saw nods to other roles too, like the white castle cutout pointing to Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle and the ape pointing to the action movie Rampage. She also talks about playing the funny girl next door, a role Malin has played in many rom-coms.</p><p>Do you agree the Squirrel is Malin Akerman or are there any clues we missed?
