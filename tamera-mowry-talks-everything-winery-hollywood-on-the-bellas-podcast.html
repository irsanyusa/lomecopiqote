Mowry married into wine-making before COVID-19 and changed the game for everybody. Since then, she was helping her family sustain their wine store.</p><p>“I don’t just wanna be the wife who’s just the wife… I want to actually learn about it,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> the Bella sisters. “And it’s not as romantic as people think it is. It’s a lot of work, ladies.”</p><p>Mowry stated that the reason why people love their bar drinks is because of its inclusivity. Apparently, they had customers coming from Oakland, San Jose, and San Franciso, California. With the keto-friendly and low-sugar spirits they offer, Mowry is evidently proud with the current state of their business.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Says Self-Authored Book Gives Pieces of Her Wisdom</h2><p>Switching the topic into Mowry’s Hollywood experiences, Nikki and Brie Bella asked the actress about her memoir titled You Should Sit Down for This: A Memoir about Life, Wine, and Cookies. According to Mowry, she wrote this book to let people know that she has “chosen happiness” despite the burdens that she carried.</p><p>“You see how I started in this business and how I didn’t let this business define me,” she said. “Even when I got Sister, Sister moving into my adulthood, surviving Hollywood and trying to stay you know, sane and not lose yourself.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mowry</a> explained that her memoir contains the chunks of wisdom that she learned throughout her journey. When asked about her hardest rejection, Mowry quickly mentioned her past daytime talk show, The Real. Reflecting on her distasteful experience in the show, Mowry knew that people’s judgments are inevitable.</p><p>“When you’re on a daytime talk show and you’re speaking of your personal experiences and your life, once you put it out there, people can do and say whatever they want with it,” she said.</p><p>According to the actress, The Real was a “very dark time” for her. Nevertheless, she said that she eventually used that to strengthen her character.</p><p>Meanwhile, somewhere else in the podcast, Nikki and Brie Bella excitedly talked about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barmagedon</a>, an upcoming celebrity game show that will be hosted by Nikki. The show will air on December 5 in the USA Network.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_DancingWiththeStars_31_Judges_ABC_Eric-McCandless.jpg alt="Here’s What to Expect on ‘DWTS’ Michael Bublé Night, Songs Revealed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5705qknqqRYrqww9GyZK2ZnKDAbrHVnqmyrJieu6h51qKlnqqpYrWwuMuyrqinlGK8r3nToZxmmpWhuaK%2FjKmmnZuRqMFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
