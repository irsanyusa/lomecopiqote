The house features pops of orange, plenty of space to host guests, and two huge walk-in closets.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rupaul-gives-tour-of-his-beverly-hills-mansion>RuPaul Gives Tour of His Beverly Hills Mansion</h2><p>RuPaul began the tour by showing off his “disco room,” which features 26 disco balls on the ceiling and a table with wheels so it can easily be moved for dancing. He then moved on to the kitchen, which includes an orange oven and bold black and white floors.</p><p>Then there’s the “dining pavilion,” which looks out on the pool and features an eye-catching striped ceiling. RuPaul said he’s “not afraid of texture and color and bold statements” in his home. That includes his office, which features bright orange walls.</p><p>The house also has a luxurious pool area, where RuPaul hosts guests and even puts on shows and movies. As he explained, “It’s all about being able to stay in one place and enjoy where we are.”</p><p>RuPaul went on to show off his sunny living room, which features jewel tones and a classic Hollywood design. He described his house as “a working house” where he can have office space but also entertain guests.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RUPAUL CALLS HIMSELF A ‘GOOD KISSER,’ REMEMBERS HIS FIRST KISS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-showed-off-his-huge-walk-in-closets>The Star Showed Off His Huge Walk-In Closets</h2><p>Arguably the coolest part of RuPaul’s house tour was when he showed off his huge walk-in closets. His men’s closet was created by transforming not one but two bedrooms in his home. He described it as a “historical artifact.”</p><p>RuPaul also has another closet that he calls the “drag archives.” The room includes gowns, shoes, and jewelry from throughout his career. He described it as “kind of like a museum.” There’s also a “glam room” nearby where he does makeup.</p><p>“You come down here, and you want to make yourself beautiful,” RuPaul said. “You want to try on everything. You actually want to lick everything. But I don’t advise that.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_JacobThomsen_OriginalSong-220x147.jpg alt="‘Alter Ego’ Winner Jacob Thomsen Sings Original Song On Intrusive Thoughts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570a6nmq2cYsCpu9asZKielmK1qr%2BMm5yvnaKhxm60yKWjrGWdlru0tc6nZKKmXaOyuHnHqKysnV2pvLa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
