The pop star has recently shared a message of body positivity addressing people’s remarks about her post-birth physique.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jessie J Says Claps Back at Body Shamers After Postpartum Comment</h2><p>In an Instagram Story, the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Price Tag</a>” performer stated that she doesn’t have any plans of “getting her body back.” Rather, she intends to deal with her figure without necessarily hating it.</p><p>“Couple of people have said to me ‘I bet you can’t wait to get your body back,'” Jessie wrote on her Instagram story. “My reply is… ‘I don’t want to go back. That body is gone. I want to go forward. I’m getting my body forward.'”</p><p>Since she gave birth to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky Safir Cornish Colman</a> in May, Jessie has been vocal about her postpartum journey. The singer has been generous in giving updates, from Sky’s adorable photos to her light workout sessions.</p><p>“That’s the vibe ladies. Embrace that bowdddddy!” she said.</p><p>In an Instagram post dated July 10, 2023, Jessie shared that her doctor has already allowed her to do “gentle exercises.” The singer then went on to joke that she’s “been jogging to the fridge for 2 weeks.”</p><p>Subsequently, Jessie explained that workout has always served as mental support for her. Hence, now that her energy is back, she’s happy to be accomplishing slow and no pressure exercises.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-shares-pumping-breastfeeding-journey>She Shares Pumping, Breastfeeding Journey</h2><p>Most recently, the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bang Bang</a>” singer opened up about her breastfeeding routine to her followers. According to Jessie, she failed to realize how exhausting pumping is until she became a mother.</p><p>“I never knew before now how amazing and beautiful but hard and tiring pumping and breastfeeding can be on your body, sleep and day to day life. I am a mover, a non sit stiller, a hands on kinda lady,” she wrote.</p><p>Jessie has particularly shared her “lifesaver” to deliver Sky’s milk supply. The singer revealed that she has purchased Elvie pumps to help her in squeezing her baby’s food.</p><p>As stated by the pop star, she hardly ever posts and promotes on her social media, but the pumps are items which she “actually uses and loves.” Jessie further revealed that she bought the product “whilst half asleep in the middle of the night.” Surprisingly, the pumps “changed my world” for the better.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_JustinBieber_HayleyBieber_Kevin-MazurGetty-Images-for-Roc-Nation-220x147.jpeg alt="Hailey Bieber Sparks Pregnancy Rumors with Alleged Baby Bump Photo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6qrKGVYrduv8euq6xllKTEr3nBqJuyZaOdrq6x0axknKedorKvwMinnmannmK1pr6MqaasrKCWv7XBzGadop%2Blp7Jw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
