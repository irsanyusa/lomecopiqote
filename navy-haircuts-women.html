The service said it was taking the step “in an effort to standardize training and education across the military services,” following orders last year from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to review hair regulations after revised Army hair rules upset some female soldiers.
The ban on haircuts will run for the first three months of this year, and is in response to female sailors complaining that the short haircuts didn’t prepare them adequately for grooming the longer hairstyles permitted once they graduated into the fleet."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Old salts can check out the written regs <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The short-hair styles shown all warn: “No portion of the bulk of the hair as measured from the scalp will exceed two inches.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The longer-hair styles mandate that “no portion of the bulk of the hair (minus the bun) will exceed two inches, as measured from the scalp,” along with other deployment options for braids, cornrows and rolls.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In what will surely come as a shock to generation of raw, crew-cutted recruits, the Navy also said it is weighing a similar relaxation for incoming male hair. “Male accessions at Officer Candidate School and Recruit Training Command are required to have their heads shaved to an eighth-inch upon arrival,” the service says. “They receive follow-up haircuts, which result in a regulation haircut by the time they reach graduation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbmVug3OFjqeYr7Fdna6qvsKuq6xlp6S6prqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
