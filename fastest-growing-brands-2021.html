In this report, we rank the top 21 fastest growing brands that have seen the biggest rise in purchasing consideration this year, how that is playing out across generations and which brands have seen a lift in purchasing consideration, even if it didn’t translate to an immediate or direct increase in buying.</p><p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Morning Consult’s Fastest Growing Brands rankings are determined by measuring growth in the share of consumers who say they would consider purchasing from a brand over the course of the year. Morning Consult Brand Intelligence tracks consumer perceptions on thousands of brands on a daily basis, forming the foundation of this report. Growth was determined by taking the share of consumers who said they were considering purchasing from the brand from Oct. 1-26, 2021, and subtracting the share who said the same from Jan. 1-31, 2021.</p><p><strong>About Brand Intelligence</strong>: Morning Consult helps you understand your brand, competitors and market in a way traditional research firms can’t.
