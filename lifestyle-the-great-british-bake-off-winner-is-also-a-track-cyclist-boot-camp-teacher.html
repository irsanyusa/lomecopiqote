On her application, she claimed to be living with David, but reports revealed that she is claiming a single person's benefit allowance, allowing her more than if she was living as a couple.</p><p><a href=# id=bea58c46-d29e-5913-9119-6c31f9afb506>According to The Sun</a>, a "Bake Off" spokesman said: "Sophie has recently declared a change in her circumstances to the DWP. A meeting to reassess her situation was postponed by her local job centre until next week. Any suggestion of benefit fraud relating to Sophie is ­categorically untrue."</p><p>Her bakes are pretty incredible — and have caught the attention of the British press.</p><p>She shares some of her bakes on Instagram. Here's a stunning cake she made for her friend's wedding...</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>...a pink ombré buttercream cake finished with chocolate drips and chocolate covered strawberries...</p><p>...an "illusion cake" she made for an old housemate...</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>...a salted caramel and chocolate tart for a Sunday lunch...</p><p>...some delicious-looking sourdough rye...</p><p>...and her ultimate favourite: a three-layer carrot cake with cream cheese frosting.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She apparently didn't discover her love for baking until she offered to make a cake for a friend. Here's a birthday cake she made for a little girl who loves ballet.</p><p>However, Faldo does much more than bake. This psychology graduate is also a former army officer who's training to be a stuntwoman.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She's also a competitive track cyclist.</p><p>According to The Sun, she started cycling to "rehabilitate myself from a back injury when I was a full time rower."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She added: "My back took longer to heal than I thought and it turned out that I preferred cycling anyway!"</p><p>Just as well, as she's won a lot of medals.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If that's not enough, she also runs some military boot camps — and she lifts some pretty heavy weights.</p><p>She's pretty into Crossfit — and even made a cake for the Crossfit Games.</p><p>Oh — and she also loves to ski.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>To fuel all this sport, she doesn't live on baked goods, and even tries to have some vegetarian days.</p><p>Her motto is reportedly: "Train hard, fight easy… one I stole from my Army days."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It served her well in the "Bake Off" tent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8uinZ6rpK65pnnToZxmn6KarrV5waugraGjnXqjrcqeZKielmLEqrrNnqlmoaNirq2%2FzmaYZqyilrCsecKymqWho6l6o7vOrWScmZ2lerWxwJyfnqpfroOnhcKvnw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
