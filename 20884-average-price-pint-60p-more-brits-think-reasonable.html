Londoners venturing outside the south east also often raise their eyebrows when getting a drink, albeit for different reasons, being delighted to receive significant change when buying a beer with a fiver.</p><p>YouGov asked more than 40,000 Britons what they considered to be a reasonable price for a pint at the pub* and compared the public’s opinion against the average prices of pints across the nation as reported by the Good Pub Guide 2018.**</p><p>The results show that national average price that Brits think is “reasonable” to pay for a pint is £3.00 – 60p lower than the usual cost of an actual pint.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Reasonable20price20pint20toplines-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The place with the greatest difference between perception and reality is in Surrey. At £4.40, the county has the most expensive pints in the county, however Surrians think the average reasonable price for a pint is £3.36 – more than a pound lower.</p><p>By contrast, the place with the smallest difference is Herefordshire. Here the average pint will set you back £3.31, only 30p more than the average reasonable price. (In Yorkshire, the other area with the joint-cheapest pints, the difference is 47p).***</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Map20difference20price20pint20320way20colou.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>While Herefordians and Yorkshiremen might have the cheapest pints, it is the residents of Northumbria and Lancashire that have the cheapest expectations.
