My stepdaughter, who is 15 years old, has been living with us every week for the past year and has been difficult when it comes to food. She first became vegan, which I accommodated by preparing meals without animal products."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Read the full story in&nbsp;our article.</p><p>My&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stepdaughter</a>, who is&nbsp;15&nbsp;years old, has been living with&nbsp;us every week for the past year and has been difficult when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;food. She first became vegan, which&nbsp;I accommodated by&nbsp;preparing meals without animal products. However, she quickly changed to&nbsp;a&nbsp;holistic diet and developed allergies to&nbsp;various foods.</p><p>My&nbsp;stepdaughter doesn’t eat lactose and gluten. She insists&nbsp;I keep her food and cookware separately, even throwing out items from the pantry that she believed were causing stomach pain. I&nbsp;told her to&nbsp;eat outside or&nbsp;do&nbsp;her cooking and cleaning herself, which she got angry about. My&nbsp;husband started yelling at&nbsp;me&nbsp;because of&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d90/b1f/a4ae415645b154fb7b447b3e90.jpg><p>After <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggesting</a> she seek professional help for her eating issues, it&nbsp;was revealed that she had no&nbsp;allergies. Despite this, she insisted on&nbsp;her beliefs. I&nbsp;reached a&nbsp;breaking point and started adding gluten and lactose to&nbsp;her meals, which she unknowingly consumed without issue. When her mother visited and praised her daughter’s improved health due to&nbsp;her new diet, I&nbsp;calmly pointed out that she had been eating the same food as&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;us.</p><p>When she realized that, this led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;confrontation, resulting in&nbsp;my&nbsp;stepdaughter and her mother leaving. My&nbsp;husband was upset with me&nbsp;because she refused to&nbsp;live with&nbsp;us anymore. I&nbsp;told him that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants his daughter to&nbsp;live with him, he&nbsp;can move out. They have since filed a&nbsp;lawsuit, but&nbsp;I stand by&nbsp;my&nbsp;actions. I&nbsp;refuse to&nbsp;cater to&nbsp;the demands of&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager with mental health issues, and will not apologize or&nbsp;make accommodations for her if&nbsp;she chooses to&nbsp;return.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;nurse working long hours, I&nbsp;cannot afford the time or&nbsp;energy to&nbsp;comply with the unrealistic expectations of&nbsp;someone with unfounded beliefs about food. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong?</p><p><h2>What was people’s reaction online?</h2></p><p>The absolute majority of&nbsp;users supported the author. Many people were angry with the husband’s reaction, his lack of&nbsp;support for his wife and his inability to&nbsp;meet his own child’s needs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b1/4cb/bb76c45ad2b1c7567256400eb3.jpg><p>Her Stepdaughter is manipulative & sneaky. She's right on all counts. If the girl's Mother is indignant then her daughter should live with her going forward, & the same goes for the Dad, or her Dad can cook her meals. Stick to your guns & remain steadfast.</p><ul><li>Your husband started yelling at&nbsp;you about&nbsp;it? Congratulations husband, you are now your daughter’s chief chef and bottle washer. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>My_Name_Is_Amos&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>If&nbsp;your husband wants to&nbsp;back up&nbsp;his daughter so&nbsp;much, he’ll learn how to&nbsp;support her dietary needs. His pawning it&nbsp;off on&nbsp;you and then yelling at&nbsp;you while he&nbsp;does nothing all shows just how “supportive” he&nbsp;actually&nbsp;is. If&nbsp;her mom is&nbsp;drinking the Kool-Aid, she can send your stepdaughter batched meals that can be&nbsp;heated up&nbsp;by&nbsp;Little Miss Princess. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>eternally_feral&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>She wanted a&nbsp;separate, different menu. Your husband is&nbsp;really stretching how long incompetence can be&nbsp;sexy with his inability to&nbsp;cook. Being a&nbsp;good father doesn’t make him a&nbsp;good husband. He&nbsp;doesn’t seem to&nbsp;respect you as&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner or&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional, unless his own credentials exceed your own in&nbsp;the healthcare industry, he&nbsp;should pull his head out of&nbsp;the sand and listen. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Last-Butterscotch-68&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/112/903/5ffdcb54919c6d8ea943e7eb73.jpg><p>Sounds like an eating disorder to me, if the stepmother is a nurse, she should know better and try to help her stepdaughter work through the fear she has for certain types of food, eating disorders are complex and there are more eating disorders than people realise. I suffer from an eating disorder and I have a fear of certain types of food, it's part of the disorder</p><p>Many also agreed there are unresolved mental health issues that girl’s parents should pay more attention&nbsp;to. Some even claimed that they might have mental health issues too.</p><ul><li>You are right that this kid needs psychological evaluation along with both her parents. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Suffering1s0ptional&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>This screams eating disorder and a&nbsp;conversion disorder as&nbsp;well, weirdly... All of&nbsp;this chaos is&nbsp;likely for attention. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Wise-Adhesiveness129&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>This sounds like orthorexia &&nbsp;her parents are just gleefully encouraging&nbsp;it. She’s 15, she has 2&nbsp;living parents. Feeding her shouldn’t be&nbsp;your job, since you obviously aren’t up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her exacting standards. Her mama can send her with food or&nbsp;her daddy can turn the stove&nbsp;on. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>WastelandMama&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>However, there were also a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;people who mentioned something that the author shouldn’t have done.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;understand why you did&nbsp;it, especially since the allergy test was negative. But no&nbsp;one should be&nbsp;fed things deceptively. You should have simply refused to&nbsp;cater to&nbsp;her demands. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hey-Just-Saying&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Maybe unpopular opinion, but&nbsp;I think it’s always wrong to&nbsp;lie to&nbsp;someone about what is&nbsp;in&nbsp;their food. That said, she can make her own meals. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Longjumping_Crab_345&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>When Emma, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stepmother, refused to&nbsp;host her stepson’s birthday party at&nbsp;her home, it&nbsp;sparked tensions with the child’s mother.
