Boss Baby Brody definitely made an impression on the panel.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-young-dancer-wows-judges-in-agt-early-release>Young Dancer Wows Judges in AGT Early Release</h2><p>For his audition, Boss Baby Brody danced to “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen, which was an appropriate song choice considering his non-stop dance routine. The performance featured some incredible acrobatics, as Brody flipped across the stage.</p><p>His dance talent was matched by his stage presence, as he showed off a fun personality through his facial expressions. There were even a few moments where he looked shocked by his own skills. Unsurprisingly, the entire panel gave Brody a standing ovation.</p><p>Judge Heidi Klum called the audition “absolutely incredible,” adding that Brody “used that whole big stage” to his advantage. Sofia Vergara called the performance “spectacular,” as she praised Brody’s use of both gymnastics and comedy in his routine.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOWIE MANDEL HITS GOLDEN BUZZER FOR SURPRISING DANCE ACT ON ‘AGT’ SEASON 19</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-praises-brody-s-amazing-showmanship>Simon Cowell Praises Brody’s ‘Amazing Showmanship’</h2><p>Simon Cowell compared Brody’s audition to hitting fast-forward on a video, adding that he was “trying to catch up” with his dance moves as he performed. He praised Brody’s song choice, since Queen’s lead singer Freddie Mercury was “one of the best showmen on the planet.”</p><p>“You’ve got that amazing showmanship and confidence,” Cowell told Brody. Howie Mandel agreed with him, complimenting Brody’s facial expressions and the way he used the stage. He asked if Brody was nervous, to which he replied simply, “No.”</p><p>It turns out that he really didn’t have anything to be nervous about, since all four judges voted “yes” to sending him through. Catch Brody’s audition, as well as several others, when AGT Season 19 returns on Tuesday night at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Britney-Spears-Jamie-Spears-Britney-Spears-documentaries-Free-Britney-scaled-1.jpeg alt="Britney Spears Calls Out ‘Abusive’ Paparazzi in Instagram Post" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57l2awnpmiYrytsIydmKeblad6o8HSrapmmV2ivLexjKKlZpmXqXqmrdGlsGaqlaGyor%2FEZpiunJmptrC6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
