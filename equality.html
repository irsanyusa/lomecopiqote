Portrait for TIME by Hank Willis Thomas and Digital Domain.</span><p>America has made strides since the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in approaching the ideal of equality on which the nation was founded, thanks to the work and resilience of countless individuals. No longer is race a barrier to entry at a <span><a href=#>lunch counter</a></span>; no longer can <span><a href=#>restrictive covenants</a></span> legally declare that only some kinds of people can buy some kinds of houses; no longer do <span><a href=#>literacy tests</a></span> block the ballot box and angry mobs block the <span><a href=#>schoolhouse door</a></span>. But look closer at today's realities in each of those arenas of American life, as this special project does, and it is clear that the dream of equality remains just that—and that the fight continues.</p><p>The most recently available Census statistics show that income inequality in America, as of 2018, is at its <span><a href=#>most extreme</a></span> point in half a century. Access to a quality education remains heavily shaped by ZIP code, while access to a safe place to live remains heavily determined by wealth. Change is still undermined by the difficulty of voting. Even the water that comes out of America's taps is unequal. This project aims to shine a light on those problems, and on those who are working to fix them.</p><p>“For every tortuous inch gained,” TIME declared when Martin Luther King Jr. was named Person of the Year for 1963, “there are miles of progress left to be covered.” That statement is no less true today.</p><h2 class=inside-the-issue>Inside The Issue</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaeqaWWuarA2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
