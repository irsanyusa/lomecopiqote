Walt’s wife Kathryn McSorley-Jodell is the story’s chaotic center, a hypochondriacal control freak and would-be Instagram lifestyle guru played with bone-deep prissiness by Jennifer Garner. The plot is minimal, but each character packs enough emotional baggage to push the scenes along: Kathryn’s meek sister Carleen (Ione Skye) arrives with her alcoholic husband (Chris Sullivan) and his sulky teenage daughter (Cheyenne Haynes) in tow. Walt’s gregarious best buddy George (Brett Gelman) drags along his wife Nina-Joy (Gelman’s real-life spouse, filmmaker Janicza Bravo), who abruptly ended her friendship with Kathryn sometime ago and has been dreading this reunion. Recently separated from his own wife, Miguel (Arturo del Puerto) has taken up with a DJ/reiki healer/CPA named Jandice (Juliette Lewis, underutilized as usual), whose free spirit and sexual openness make Kathryn McSorley-Jodell extremely uncomfortable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As these tensions fester, everyone nurses a wound or a secret, the way old friends at The Big Chill-like gatherings always do. Rooted in her own vague pelvic woes, Kathryn’s obsession with injury and illness is ruining her son’s (Duncan Joiner) childhood and trying her husband’s patience. The seams in Jandice’s hedonistic lifestyle start to show. Strangely, however, none of these revelations deepen characters that come across as either broad types (Kathryn, Jandice, Joe) or half-formed foils for those oddballs (everyone else).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An eclectic cast of actors playing largely against type does its best to smooth over uneven characterizations: comedian and cabaret star Bridget Everett, best known for stealing scenes in Trainwreck and Lady Dynamite, is a standout, dripping rugged charm in a recurring role as the campground’s butch lesbian proprietor Harry. Tennant, a former Doctor Who lead who also played the diabolical Kilgrave in Netflix’s hit Jessica Jones, further demonstrates his range as a long-suffering husband who truly loves his nutty wife. It’s just a shame that his understated performance belongs to a different universe from Kathryn’s larger-than-life neuroses.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The original Camping, which aired on Sky Atlantic in 2016, offers some clues as to what went wrong. Carrying on a proud tradition of British humor about decent people forced to tolerate narcissists (The Office, Keeping Up Appearances, Absolutely Fabulous), the slight yet droll comedy cast creator Julia Davis as an older, stodgier, more out-of-touch version of Garner’s lead. But Dunham and Konner clearly wanted to satirize a type more familiar to them, making Kathryn a liberal helicopter mom in a Don’t Hate Meditate sweatshirt, despite giving her lines–“Christ on a cracker!”–that no one in that particular social group would ever say. Similarly, though Lewis’ counterpart in the original series also oozes sexual energy, an added layer of New Age silliness makes Jandice a flightier caricature. Through no fault of Lewis’, a late attempt to give her some depth, in one of many scenes imported directly from the U.K. version, just doesn’t ring true.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dunham and Konner could have avoided this dissonance by taking significantly more or less from the original: by either filming a shot-for-shot remake of the show or reimagining Davis’ premise with entirely new characters for an American audience. Instead, Camping wanders down both paths–and gets lost in the woods.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubGJmgneFjqWcp5ldmcKvtMCmZJyZnaW2r7OO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
