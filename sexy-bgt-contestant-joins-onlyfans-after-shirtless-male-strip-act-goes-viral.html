They ditched their shirts and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>put on an incredible show</a> for everyone. It’s no surprise that one of the members of the group, Ash Edelman, went on to create an OnlyFans account after appearing on the show in 2015.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-member-of-bgt-strip-act-forbidden-nights-joins-onlyfans>Member Of ‘BGT’ Strip Act Forbidden Nights Joins OnlyFans</h2><p>This viral ‘BGT’ act started when one member of Forbidden Nights, Lewis Codling took the stage. It seemed like it was going to be a solo singing act but it turned out to be so much more. He began singing an a cappella version of “Let’s Get It On” by Marvin Gaye before he pretended that his microphone wasn’t working. Crew members came out onto the stage to help out, but it turns out they were members of Forbidden Nights in disguise.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW TRISHA PAYTAS WENT FROM RAPPING ON ‘AGT’ TO MAKING MILLIONS ON ONLYFANS</a></strong></p><p>They launched into an exciting number where they ripped off their shirts on stage and danced along to the song. They ripped off their pants by the end of the performance. The audience went absolutely wild and they were voted into the next round of the competition. Their audition now has over 82 million views on YouTube.</p><p>Though they didn’t win the show, they certainly stole the hearts of everyone watching at home. Forbidden Nights has gone on a UK tour and even has a London residency for their iconic strip show. Some of their shows have been postponed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic but they continue to post content that fans love on Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJeZpVIlELj/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-all-about-the-dancer-that-joined-the-adult-site>All About The Dancer That Joined The Adult Site</h3><p>Forbidden Nights member Ash “Ozzy” Edelman is showing off a different side of himself on his OnlyFans page.
