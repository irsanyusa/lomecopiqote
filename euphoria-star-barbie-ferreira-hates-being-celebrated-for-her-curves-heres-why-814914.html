Her recent opinion has gotten many netizens talking, and here’s what she has to&nbsp;say about this modern tendency.</p><p><h2>Barbie has her own attitude toward body positivity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/63d/54d/b990b658f7842c592c3e4ac251.jpg><p>Model and actress, Barbie Ferreira is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disappointed</a> with the current talks around bodies and size.</p><p>Just like her character in&nbsp;<i>Euphoria</i>, Barbie puts the very point of&nbsp;the body positivity movement under scrutiny. She has doubts about whether it’s even possible to&nbsp;achieve true happiness with your body. It’s very much similar to&nbsp;what her character Kat experiences in&nbsp;<i>Euphoria</i>, when she has a&nbsp;meltdown about all the societal pressure to&nbsp;love your body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/53a/b58/3e826f564dad5f1b378d69406c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her interview, Barbie speaks openly about the problem of&nbsp;self-love, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;hope other people can also feel the same way and release the pressure of&nbsp;being perfect and happy all the time. Because that just doesn’t exist.”</p><p>And Ferreira, who used to&nbsp;model before joining the show, thinks the massive acceptance of&nbsp;curvy bodies that started with her debut in&nbsp;the industry has since reverted back.</p><p><h2>The curvy actress can’t stand being celebrated for what she wears.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/194/9a9/9d008657da957cf7b8185ff8d8.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;think bigger bodies are not as ’trendy’ as&nbsp;they used to&nbsp;be, which is&nbsp;really sad to&nbsp;me. But it’s more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;conversation of&nbsp;the fact that we&nbsp;all struggle with self-love, and&nbsp;I don’t think any young person has really figured it&nbsp;out yet,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> Barbie in&nbsp;her interview.</p><p>The actress frowns upon people applauding her for wearing <a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> that are meant for thinner bodies. They think that by&nbsp;doing&nbsp;so, Barbie is&nbsp;supporting the body positivity movement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c69/a8d/9714ba52f0b971c7c475081a47.jpg><p>“It’s not radical for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;crop top,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>. “Comments like those are just backhanded compliments. I’ve been doing this since&nbsp;I was 16.”</p><p>The actress also finds that there’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pressure for herto&nbsp;love her body because of&nbsp;her size. “It’s so&nbsp;funny that people just assume that,” she says. “What&nbsp;— did&nbsp;I say that? I&nbsp;never said that. You guys just say that. You posted that on&nbsp;<i>me</i>.”</p><p><h2>The actress has a&nbsp;good solution for the problem.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/261/641/c407f7592b86805aa4ff444768.jpg><p>What Barbie thinks could help more people love their bodies, is&nbsp;if&nbsp;clothing producers were more size-inclusive. “I&nbsp;have all the resources in&nbsp;the world to&nbsp;get something that fits, and it’s still extremely difficult,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “So&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel for everyone who’s still trying to&nbsp;find things that fit them.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;could do&nbsp;a&nbsp;seminar on&nbsp;this,” she adds. “I&nbsp;always think about the fact that if&nbsp;these clothes came in&nbsp;my&nbsp;size, I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;out here doing even more.”</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re interested in&nbsp;alternative opinions on&nbsp;body positivity, you might want to&nbsp;find out why this trend doesn’t actually promote <a href=#>obesity</a>. There’s an&nbsp;explanation on&nbsp;what body positivity really&nbsp;is, and why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not about boosting health issues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLK2vMeoqaKZXajBor6Mm5irmpmaeqex0aucoqqRYrWiwMSsZJudmaO0bq%2FEpZybqpGpsqV5xaipZqCVp3qkwdGvnKxlmJq%2Fpr%2BMsJ%2ByZWhmgXp9k2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
