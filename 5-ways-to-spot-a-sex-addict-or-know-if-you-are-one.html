People are used as tools by sex addicts</h3></p><p>They view people are objects to satisfy their sexual cravings. Sex addicts are masters at deceit, fabrication, and making shallow promises.</p><p>To get what they want, they would emotionally blackmail other people and do whatever it takes to persuade their victims to comply with their requests because they constantly need to satiate their sexual cravings.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>2. They love drama</h3></p><p>Drama is an addiction for sex addicts, and their lives are constantly in peril. Life becomes essentially unmanageable whether it is their jobs, relationships, finances or health.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The absolute sexual preoccupation causes these people to spend all their free time planning, pursuing, and covering up their addiction to sex. As a result, they have no time left for anything else. The vicious cycle of drama and turmoil keeps repeating itself.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-de638a0c-f8d7-4a83-9168-d057433382c9 data-caption="Here's how to spot sex addiction [blacklove]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/xRUktkpTURBXy81MjI1ODAwNDdjNzdiYTE0NGNhZWI4YzY3YzhmMGMwOS5wbmeRlQLNAxbNAf3Cww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>3. Sex addicts crave dangerous sex</h3></p><p>Their sexual cravings are irrepressible, and they frequently act out in more extreme ways than they had initially anticipated. They have no limits, no lines or boundaries they can't cross.</p><p>Sex addicts become desirous of riskier or more intense sexual behaviour as their addiction worsens, and they are unable to control their urges. They develop an obsession with the intensity of sex, and are fueled by risk-taking behaviour but they never feel content no matter how far they go.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>4. Sex addicts masturbate a lot</h3></p><p>Masturbating excessively is a daily habit for sex addicts. These people masturbate in the morning, afternoon, and evening and it doesn't matter where they are, they would make time to masturbate.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>5. Sexual addicts lead two lives</h3></p><p>Sex addicts are essentially two individuals living two separate lives. They can only maintain their addiction as a part of their hidden lives, but nothing is hidden for long until it negatively affects every element of their lives, including their relationships, finances and, careers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2BmrdStsGaglZa5tbSObmSwmamoerW7jKynqKxdlnq0sddmmJ2cmZjBbrvRZqKnp6ditqd52KisZpmimnqwusRoo3Gelaa7rA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
