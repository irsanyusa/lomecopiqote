In years past, he says, administrators rebuffed his entreaties. But in the wake of the heavily publicized September suicide of Rutgers freshman <a title="Cyberbullying? Homophobia? Tyler Clementi's Death Highlights Online Lawlessness" href=#>Tyler Clementi</a> — the gay student who jumped from the George Washington Bridge after his roommate allegedly streamed video on the Internet of his homosexual encounter in their dorm room — campus housing officials have agreed to make at least 100 spaces in three dorms available to students who feel uneasy living with someone of the same sex. (<strong>More on Time.com</strong>: <a href=#>Cyberbullying? Homophobia? Tyler Clementi’s Death Highlights Online Lawlessness</a>)</p><p>“It definitely was a wake-up call,” says Jeffrey Chang, a Rutgers law student and co-founder of the National Student Genderblind Campaign, which advocates for LGBT-friendly policies. “The real issue is safety. Many college students who are LGBT may not feel comfortable in their dorm rooms, but it wasn’t until Tyler Clementi’s suicide that a lot of schools started seeing the difficulties these students face.”</p><p>Two months ago, Joan Carbone, the university’s executive director of residence life, met with student representatives of the college’s LGBT community, whom she says became “more vocal” after Clementi’s death. For four hours, she listened to their concerns. “They were very clear about why this was important to them,” she says. “Living in a small space with someone who doesn’t accept who you are is a difficult situation.”</p><p>Rutgers is calling its new co-ed living arrangements “gender-neutral housing” because students can choose to live with whomever they want: two men, two women or a woman and a man. Freshmen will not be able to select a roommate, but they can indicate a preference for an open-minded person who is welcoming of different sexual orientations.

For most of his time at Rutgers, he’s lived in a room designed to accommodate one person, which helped him feel safe but also served to isolate him.</p><p>“A roommate is your first friend,” says Lee, who’s studying evolutionary anthropology and women’s and gender studies. “You go to the dining hall together, you meet people together, and I was precluded from having that. For a while, I felt like dropping out of school.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTLmqWdZqSeuqZ6wqikaGpgZn5wfJJoZ2xnYmx%2BeYKO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
