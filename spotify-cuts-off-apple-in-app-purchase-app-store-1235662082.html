There was only about a two-year window (from June 2014 to May 2016) during which Spotify Premium subs could opt to sign up and pay through the Apple App Store. Now, Spotify is no longer letting those customers continue paying through Apple’s in-app purchases."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, Spotify is no longer letting those customers continue paying through Apple’s in-app purchases.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In recent emails to those subscribers, Spotify said, “We’re contacting you because when you joined Spotify Premium you used Apple’s billing service to subscribe. Unfortunately, we no longer accept that billing method as a form of payment.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The email notification tells Spotify customers that at the end of the final billing period, their account will “automatically switch to our Free, ad-supported service… If you wish to keep your Premium subscription, you will need to re-subscribe after your last billing period has ended and your account has been moved on to the Free account.” They will then need to choose to pay via one of the payment methods Spotify accepts, including credit cards and PayPal, to start the new subscription.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a statement, a Spotify rep said the company recently began notifying “a small number of users that a legacy payment method, that their Premium account is attached to, is being deprecated. Users notified by email will automatically move to a Free account from their next billing cycle. Users will then have the option to upgrade to a Premium account by logging into their account at Spotify.com.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Spotify spokesperson added, “These actions will help ensure that we can continue to provide a consistent best-in-class subscription experience for all our users.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Spotify has had a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">long-running feud with Apple</a>, accusing Apple of employing anticompetitive tactics with its app store policies. In 2019, <a href=#>Spotify filed a formal complaint with the European Commission</a> charging that Apple unfairly limits choice and competition through the App Store.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Spotify also objected to Google’s Play Store policies, which also take a percentage fee of purchases. But last year, Spotify and Google announced a multiyear agreement that will give users who have downloaded the Spotify Android app from the Google Play Store the <a href=#>choice to pay with either Spotify’s payment system or with Google Play Billing</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the grand scheme of things, Spotify’s fully ending support for Apple in-app purchases won’t affect many customers. In a <a href=#>2019 regulatory filing</a>, Apple said it collected a 15% fee on subscription payments for just 680,000 of Spotify’s more than 100 million Premium subscribers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2Fjp2goKGklrlwusSwqmiroKTBqrLYZpqurKNivKeyjJqnqaSVYravecCpp2aopaewqa3SnmSaqKBiwLW70Z5kampjaoN3fo9xaWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
