The technology is able to generate lifelike talking faces of virtual characters using a single image and speech audio clip. The AI can make cartoon characters, photographs, and paintings sing or talk, as evidenced in<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> footage</a> Microsoft released as part of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> published on April 16.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the most viral clip, the woman in the Mona Lisa painting sings, her mouth, eyes and face moving, to “Paparazzi,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a rap Hathaway wrote</a> and performed on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Conan O’Brien</a>’s talk show in 2011. In another Microsoft clip, an avatar sings, and in others generated from real photos, people speak on common-place topics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The videos quickly gained traction online: One post on X, formerly Twitter, on April 18 featuring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the singing Mona Lisa clip and others</a> had garnered seven million views as of Sunday.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Microsoft just dropped VASA-1.</p><p>This AI can make single image sing and talk from audio reference expressively.

Mona Lisa rapping Paparazzi <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LSGF3mMVnD</a></p>— Min Choi (@minchoi) <a href=#>April 18, 2024</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The online reactions were swift, strong and across the board. Some enjoyed the clips, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one commenter posting</a> that the Mona Lisa video had them “rolling on (the) floor laughing.” Others were more wary or even disturbed. “This is wild, freaky, and creepy all at once,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one said</a>. “Another day, another terrifying AI video,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another lamented</a>. “Why does this need to exist? I can’t think of any positives,” one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">commenter criticized.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Microsoft’s researchers addressed the risks of the new technology and said they have no plans to release an online demo or product “until we are certain that the technology will be used responsibly and in accordance with proper regulations.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It is not intended to create content that is used to mislead or deceive,” the researchers wrote. “However, like other related content generation techniques, it could still potentially be misused for impersonating humans. We are opposed to any behavior to create misleading or harmful contents of real persons, and are interested in applying our technique for advancing forgery detection.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“While acknowledging the possibility of misuse, it's imperative to recognize the substantial positive potential of our technique,” they said. “The benefits—such as enhancing educational equity, improving accessibility for individuals with communication challenges, offering companionship or therapeutic support to those in need, among many others—underscore the importance of our research and other related explorations. We are dedicated to developing AI responsibly, with the goal of advancing human well-being.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The latest development in AI comes as governments around the world <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">are scrambling</a> to regulate the new technology and legislate against its criminal misuse.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One example is deepfake pornography, where the face of an individual is superimposed onto an explicit picture or video without their consent, an issue that even affected <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift </a>earlier this year. In the U.S., while 10 states criminalize deepfakes, federal law does not, and multiple bills <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have been introduced in Congress </a>to rectify this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWZugnN8jpqgZqyVmLWvu8uonrJlpp6xpruMpqanmV2htrStjKuYqaiZo7Ruu82loKedXaeyoq%2FToqanZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
