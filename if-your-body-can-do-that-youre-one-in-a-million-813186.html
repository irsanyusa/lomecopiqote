How can you reach with your tongue into your nose from inside<strong>?</strong> And WHY would you even do&nbsp;that?! See further if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;real superpower! About a&nbsp;third of&nbsp;all people can raise one eyebrow: left or&nbsp;right. It’s a&nbsp;great way to&nbsp;send a&nbsp;playful signal to&nbsp;someone while telling a&nbsp;joke. But the ability to&nbsp;raise both eyebrows separately is&nbsp;much rarer. If&nbsp;you’re not among them, that’s because you cannot yet control and move the corresponding muscles. But this skill can be&nbsp;developed. Stand in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mirror, hold one eyebrow with your hand and lift the other up&nbsp;and down. And then do&nbsp;the same with the other eyebrow. This will help you learn moving them separately.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/023/d1f/ac256d5e72b89ef649dd7952b9.png><p>Can you sit down on&nbsp;the floor and get back without the help of&nbsp;your hands or&nbsp;knees? This simple challenge is&nbsp;called the ’<strong>Sitting Rising Test</strong>’. Clever name. Although scientists argue whether this test is&nbsp;trustworthy in&nbsp;telling anything about your health, you can still use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;check whether your muscles and heart are strong enough. If&nbsp;you’re unable to&nbsp;get off the floor without the support of&nbsp;your hands or&nbsp;knees, maybe it’s time to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;the gym<strong>. </strong>Stretch out your hand and place a&nbsp;ring on&nbsp;the crook of&nbsp;your elbow, then rotate your palm. If&nbsp;the ring didn’t fall, you’re a&nbsp;rare person. Some say only&nbsp;<strong>2%</strong> of&nbsp;people can do&nbsp;that, but that’s arguable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1a9/c1b/264bad5b31b5d8304c6c268c8c.png><p>If&nbsp;you can lick your elbow easily, or&nbsp;touch your thumb to&nbsp;your forearm&nbsp;— congratulations, you’re among the minority of&nbsp;people. But some people bring flexibility to&nbsp;the next level. This condition is&nbsp;called hypermobility. It&nbsp;allows rare individuals to&nbsp;twist their bodies into weird positions just like a&nbsp;snake: putting their head between their feet, doing a&nbsp;back bridge, and all sorts of&nbsp;splits. But in&nbsp;some cases, hypermobility can increase sensitivity, because such people have a&nbsp;larger medulla. This <a href=# title=brain data-link=tag>brain</a> area is&nbsp;responsible for processing emotions.</p><p>90% of&nbsp;people are right-handed, and only&nbsp;10% are left-handed. Yes, that adds&nbsp;up. But there’s also a&nbsp;very small percentage of&nbsp;those who can use both hands equally well, including writing, drawing, and doing any tasks. Naturally, ambidextrous people account for only&nbsp;1% of&nbsp;the entire population, which is&nbsp;about 70&nbsp;million people. If&nbsp;you wanna check whether you’re one of&nbsp;them, try to&nbsp;write the same phrase with both hands or&nbsp;draw a&nbsp;circle first with your right and then with your left hand. If&nbsp;there’s no&nbsp;difference, congrats! By&nbsp;the way, these exercises are very good for balancing the hemispheres of&nbsp;the brain, regardless of&nbsp;which hand is&nbsp;your working one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2df/f80/fbdbe254bbac5d3a1e9a959aca.png><p>Mirror writing is&nbsp;another good way to&nbsp;awaken your neurons. Wake up&nbsp;wake&nbsp;up! Leonardo Da&nbsp;Vinci used to&nbsp;write down his thoughts in&nbsp;a&nbsp;journal from right to&nbsp;left. The actual purpose of&nbsp;his mirror writings is&nbsp;still unknown, but some people suggest that he&nbsp;just tried to&nbsp;prevent smudging the ink because he&nbsp;was left-handed. Creating a&nbsp;mirrored text is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;easy task for most people.</p><p>Most people depend on&nbsp;weather forecasts and have to&nbsp;adjust their outfits depending on&nbsp;the season to&nbsp;avoid catching a&nbsp;cold. But not everyone&nbsp;— lucky ones have learned to&nbsp;keep their bodies warm in&nbsp;any frost. These fearless heroes can walk in&nbsp;the cold wearing only swimming trunks and feel cozy. They can stand in&nbsp;the snow barefoot and even swim in&nbsp;a&nbsp;river or&nbsp;an&nbsp;ice hole. Usually, this talent doesn’t come naturally, people temper their bodies for years until they get used to&nbsp;withstand extreme cold. Of&nbsp;course, they don’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;just to&nbsp;look cool. Or&nbsp;feel cool. Health benefits from this procedure include better blood circulation, increased concentration, and an&nbsp;overall sense of&nbsp;well-being. And how many seconds can you stand barefoot in&nbsp;the snow? Not many!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0e1/689/8a352c560398f3869910d56b73.png><p>Stretch out your palms in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you. Squeeze together all of&nbsp;your fingers except your thumb. Now spread the index and middle fingers and a&nbsp;ring finger with the little finger in&nbsp;different directions. Success? If&nbsp;so, you’d probably make a&nbsp;wonderful musician, because the nerves in&nbsp;your palms are well-developed.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you feel ticklish when you tickle yourself? Normally, you wouldn’t, unless someone else tickles you. It&nbsp;happens because the cerebellum area of&nbsp;the brain, which monitors movements, predicts the sensations caused by&nbsp;your own movements. Then, it&nbsp;sends a&nbsp;signal to&nbsp;other parts of&nbsp;the nervous system to&nbsp;cancel these sensations. But some rare individuals can actually feel ticklish on&nbsp;their own. If&nbsp;you’re not among them, touching a&nbsp;new texture that the brain doesn’t yet recognize or&nbsp;using a&nbsp;scalp massager can help to&nbsp;excite your nerves and bring relaxation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/759/e62/0599405ce9b6310a2fef9468d4.png><p>Grab a&nbsp;sheet of&nbsp;paper and something to&nbsp;write with and sit on&nbsp;a&nbsp;chair. Stretch one leg and rotate your foot clockwise. Try to&nbsp;draw the number <strong>6&nbsp;</strong>on paper or&nbsp;in&nbsp;the air while still rotating your foot. This task is&nbsp;so&nbsp;much a&nbsp;struggle because the left area of&nbsp;your brain can’t handle two opposite rotations at&nbsp;the same time. That’s why the brain tries to&nbsp;bring all movements in&nbsp;the same direction. Only a&nbsp;few people can manage it&nbsp;from the first attempt. You can also try to&nbsp;write other numbers and watch the funny results. Seems like the foot has no&nbsp;problem only with zero.</p><p>If&nbsp;you wanna check out the work of&nbsp;your vestibular system, try this simple trick. Stand on&nbsp;one foot and close your eyes. Most people lose balance at&nbsp;least during the first attempt. Your vestibular system includes many organs and systems throughout your body. Together, they allow your body to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;balance in&nbsp;different positions. This system includes the inner ear and vision, which is&nbsp;why keeping balance is&nbsp;much easier in&nbsp;silence while your eyes are open.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ac6/8cd/68ed6751b4bc16339b9168f03e.png><p>Every day, people use their tongue to&nbsp;recognize different tastes and communicate with each other. But it’s also a&nbsp;great tool for a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;tricks. Around&nbsp;10% of&nbsp;people can touch the tip of&nbsp;their nose with their tongue. The current title of&nbsp;<strong>the world’s longest tongue </strong>belongs to&nbsp;<strong>Nick Stoeberl</strong> from the USA&nbsp;— his tongue measures <strong>3.97 inches (10.1&nbsp;cm)</strong>, according to&nbsp;Guinness World Records. There’s also another contender whose name is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Indian Book of&nbsp;Records for the tongue measuring whopping <strong>10.8 inches (27&nbsp;cm)</strong>! Wow, imagine what can he&nbsp;do&nbsp;with to&nbsp;an&nbsp;ice cream cone! But the average adult <strong>male</strong> tongue is&nbsp;only about <strong>3.3 inches (8.5&nbsp;cm)</strong> long, and the average <strong>female</strong> tongue is&nbsp;<strong>3.1 inches (7.9&nbsp;cm)</strong>. That’s why most people can’t perform the ’nose trick’ that easily.</p><p>Tying a&nbsp;cherry stem in&nbsp;a&nbsp;knot is&nbsp;a&nbsp;popular party challenge, but only a&nbsp;few people can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;right and quickly. <strong>Al&nbsp;Gliniecki</strong> set the World Guinness Record in&nbsp;June of&nbsp;2014 when he&nbsp;made <strong>14&nbsp;cherry stem knots</strong> in&nbsp;one minute using only his tongue! Wow! If&nbsp;you wanna try to&nbsp;beat his record, practice with patience and pick longer stems around 1.5 inches long. Plenty of&nbsp;tutorials on&nbsp;this topic at&nbsp;your service.</p><p>Stand in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mirror, open your mouth and try to&nbsp;roll the sides of&nbsp;your tongue up&nbsp;towards each other to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;U-shape. About 65&nbsp;to&nbsp;81% of&nbsp;people are natural tongue rollers, and the majority are women. Some believe it’s a&nbsp;genetic capability, but recent studies showed that people can actually develop this skill by&nbsp;practicing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/862/7b2/29010956aba2fc78eca0f9b27f.png><p><strong>‘Khechari Mudra</strong>’ is&nbsp;a&nbsp;term from yoga that means curling the tip of&nbsp;your tongue back into the mouth. Ideally, it&nbsp;should reach above the soft palate and rest in&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the nasal cavity. This asana helps refresh the mind and body and overcome thirst, hunger, and anxiety. Some say it&nbsp;also helps become a&nbsp;professional lucid dreamer if&nbsp;you acquire a&nbsp;habit to&nbsp;fall asleep with khechari mudra every night. But most yoga beginners spend months and even years to&nbsp;reach into the nasal cavity. And if&nbsp;you can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;right away, you’re the lucky one.</p><p>Can you wiggle your ears intentionally? Congratulations, around&nbsp;<strong>22%</strong> of&nbsp;people on&nbsp;the Earth are capable of&nbsp;wiggling one ear. As&nbsp;for moving both ears at&nbsp;once, only&nbsp;18% can do&nbsp;that. Ear wiggling used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;common thing for our distant ancestors. Scientists believe they could perform a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;movements with their ears. The group of&nbsp;muscles responsible for wiggling is&nbsp;called the auriculars, and we&nbsp;mostly don’t need it&nbsp;today. But some people claim that everyone can learn to&nbsp;move their ears, it&nbsp;only takes time and practice. Unfortunately, we&nbsp;still cannot acquire this classy habit of&nbsp;twitching an&nbsp;ear towards a&nbsp;sound source as&nbsp;dogs and cats&nbsp;do.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorKtlkqSxunnCmqVmnJ9iwamt02awqK2imnqwusRmoKdlkWK6qrjLoqanZWhmgHKElWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
