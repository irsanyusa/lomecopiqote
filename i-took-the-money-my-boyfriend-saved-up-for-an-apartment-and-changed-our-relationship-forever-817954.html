My boyfriend comes from a poor family.
He grew up in a family where every dollar matters. His parents worked long hours in physically demanding jobs and often came home exhausted."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Let’s dive into the details.</p><p><h2>My&nbsp;boyfriend comes from a&nbsp;poor family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f9/2a6/2ed7805bf5a49f4630109e1ff6.jpg><p>He&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> where every dollar matters. His parents worked long hours in&nbsp;physically demanding jobs and often came home exhausted.</p><p>Money was always tight, they had to&nbsp;scrape together coins just to&nbsp;buy groceries for the week. Luxuries like eating out or&nbsp;going on&nbsp;vacations weren’t even thought&nbsp;of. All of&nbsp;them wore hand-me-downs and buying something brand new was a&nbsp;<a href=# title=dream data-link=tag>dream</a>.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;have his own apartment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b2b/c32/5c34725bf59d32710ae49f5db4.jpg><p>When he&nbsp;got older, he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;better life for himself. He&nbsp;already worked 3&nbsp;jobs when we&nbsp;met each other and saved every penny. His health was getting worse each month, and&nbsp;I was very worried.</p><p>Finally, after years of&nbsp;hard work, he&nbsp;saved up&nbsp;$250k for a&nbsp;small apartment on&nbsp;the outskirts of&nbsp;town. It&nbsp;looked terrible and was definitely overpriced for its condition, but it&nbsp;was the only thing he&nbsp;could afford.</p><p><h2>I&nbsp;took his money.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb9/6d7/ce9c7c53ecb3a08c0b488b6f0b.jpg><p>The day before he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;buy the apartment with the $250k he’d saved&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;clue that his savings had actually doubled. He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;whopping $500k! What he&nbsp;didn’t realize was that&nbsp;I had been quietly saving up&nbsp;the same amount every month too. Seeing how hard he&nbsp;worked without ever complaining, I&nbsp;knew he&nbsp;deserved something better than just a&nbsp;basic apartment.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;was shocked.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/279/2f2/aa646b5612b929dd5d1fe86243.jpg><p>The next day, he&nbsp;agreed to&nbsp;meet the seller and was about to&nbsp;leave the house. I&nbsp;stopped him and handed him an&nbsp;envelope. He&nbsp;looked confused, and his jaw almost dropped when he&nbsp;saw the money.</p><p>He&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;what it&nbsp;was, and&nbsp;I explained that&nbsp;I just wanted to&nbsp;help him. At&nbsp;first, he&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;take the money. He&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;only after&nbsp;I asked him&nbsp;to.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;finally bought his dream apartment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78d/5f7/b61b9a5ba6b7fce062b63a8db3.jpg><p>We&nbsp;found a&nbsp;good apartment that looked much better than the one he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;buy. He&nbsp;was over the moon when we&nbsp;moved&nbsp;in. We’re getting married soon, and we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;family.</p><p>I&nbsp;still remember the joy on&nbsp;his face when he&nbsp;saw the money. It’s moments like those that warm my&nbsp;heart.</p><p>Thank you for such a&nbsp;heartwarming message, we&nbsp;are happy to&nbsp;share it&nbsp;with our readers. Love is&nbsp;wonderful, however, not for everyone. In&nbsp;<a href=#>this article</a>, our reader’s friend wants her to&nbsp;babysit his girlfriend and spend some nights with her while he’s away.
